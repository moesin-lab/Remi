/**
 * Live Hub contracts (MUL-403, message architecture v2-C; ADR 0007).
 *
 * One in-process hub is the single fan-out point for two ordered streams:
 *
 * - `log:<session_id>`  — MUL-402's conversation-log display units and hidden
 *   markers, ordered by the row's own `seq`.
 * - `trace:<task_id>`   — MUL-401's trace events, ordered by the daemon-assigned
 *   `trace_seq`. The hub never renumbers: its cursor and MUL-402's file offsets
 *   both speak the daemon's numbering.
 *
 * Type and constant module only: no I/O, no timers, no runtime dependency on the
 * server. The implementation skeleton lives in
 * `packages/server/src/api/hub/` and is empty in C0; C1 fills it in.
 *
 * Deliberately absent from the root barrel (`src/index.ts`): this module ships
 * runtime values, and a barrel value-import is what broke `next build` twice
 * (MUL-108, MUL-314). Consumers import the `@multiremi/contracts/live-hub`
 * subpath instead.
