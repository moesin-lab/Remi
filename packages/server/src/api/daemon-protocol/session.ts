/**
 * One daemon's v2 connection (MUL-417, spec §1-§2, §8).
 *
 * A session owns everything that is per-connection and in memory:
 *
 *   - the handshake (`hello` -> `welcome` | `reject`), including the per-runtime
 *     authorization that decides 4401/4403/4410;
 *   - the downlink sequence, which starts at 1 on every connection and is never
 *     persisted - the downlink is re-derived from the database on reconnect
 *     (ADR 0012), so a queue here would be a second source of truth;
 *   - the acknowledgement deadline: every reliable downlink frame records its
 *     send time, and a frame unacknowledged for `DAEMON_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` closes
 *     the connection with 4000;
 *   - backpressure, driven by the `ws.send` return value;
 *   - serialized frame processing.
 *
 * SERIALIZATION. Bun calls `message` without awaiting the previous call, so two
 * frames can interleave at every `await`. The session keeps one promise chain and
 * appends each inbound frame to it, so a handler always observes the state left
 * by the frame before it. The chain never rejects: a rejected chain would
 * silently stop processing every later frame on that connection.
 *
 * BACKPRESSURE. `ws.send` answers with the bytes sent (> 0), `-1` (queued, the
 * socket is behind) or `0` (dropped - the connection is gone). `-1` pauses the
 * pausable traffic and is cleared by the socket's `drain` callback rather than by
 * the next successful send, because a small successful send does not prove the
 * queue caught up. `res` and `ack` are never paused: they release the peer's
 * window, and stalling them deadlocks both sides. `0` unregisters the connection.
