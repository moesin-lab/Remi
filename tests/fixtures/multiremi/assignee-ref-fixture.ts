// MUL-473: fixture for the assignee-reference resolution equivalence suite.
//
// The PR1 branch added a `usr_ -> member` prefix inference to
// `inferAssigneeTypeFromRef`, which locked the branch before the historical
// "try agent, then member, then squad" order could run. QA's counterexample is a
// legal Agent whose *name* happens to look like a user id: the old code resolved
// it as that Agent, the new code refused it as a missing member.
//
// Equivalence therefore has to be asserted against the old implementation's
// answers, not against a restatement of the new rules. This fixture seeds the
// shapes that can collide, and `capture-assignee-ref-golden.ts` records what
// `593ff2ba` returned for each of them. Every value below is explicit so the
// capture and the assertion run over the same rows.
