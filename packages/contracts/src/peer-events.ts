/**
 * Wire contract for the cross-process realtime peer channel (MUL-462, MUL-455 §1.4).
 *
 * When the API is split into a browser-facing process and a daemon-facing one,
 * the store's in-process listeners only see the writes of their own runtime.
 * The peer channel carries those events to the other side over a loopback HTTP
 * POST; the receiver only delivers them locally and never forwards them
 * again, so the two sides cannot ping-pong an event forever.
 *
 * The envelope is deliberately small and versioned: `v` is the only field a
 * receiver may branch on before it trusts the rest, and `origin` exists so a
 * process can drop a message it somehow receives back from itself.
 *
 * Task messages carry a six-field routing subject or a persisted seq reference;
 * other event kinds retain their store shape. Ordered, numbered batches retry
 * identical bytes and receivers deduplicate within their process lifetime.
