# MUL-447 Step 1 Evidence

Scope: step 1 items 1-4 implemented; item 5 deferred under the issue's explicit
fallback. Steps 2 and 3 are not implemented. Independent strict QA is pending.

## Inputs

- Initial branch: `agent/MUL-447` at `b95dd2fa`.
- Ordered merge of `agent/MUL-403` at `c366a949`: `6fd1e434`.
- Then merge of `agent/MUL-421` at `17e92d48`: `f0f340b9`.
- Before the final push, merged the updated parent at `d81525cb` (Hub #308).
  Main synchronization remains owned by MUL-436 step 3. The combined startup
  preserves the single role resolution, peer fanout, v2 daemon drain and browser
  Hub drain; role-only fixtures explicitly inject the existing EmptyLiveHub.
- Parent rulings: `cmt_i2j9hbxusljl`, `cmt_culn1zd0rgk3`.
- Prerequisite reconciliation: `69143233`. It preserves the main branch's
  batched runtime list and MUL-421's protocol projection, without raising the
  existing query-count budgets. The wire golden adds only prerequisite protocol
  fields; replica fixture changes correct types, not QA assertions.
- The result-comment regression fixture uses the existing v2 `reportFrame`
  dispatch instead of the HTTP start/complete routes removed by MUL-421. Its
  runtime metadata now advertises the real daemon's parallel execution
  capability. Result, prompt, snapshot and SELECT-count assertions are unchanged.

## Acceptance Mapping

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Resume at `throughSeq + 1`, no duplicates or omissions | `tests/unit/connectors/feishu-trace-subscription.test.ts`: consumed checkpoint case; `tests/unit/multiremi/feishu-concierge-host.test.ts`: saved checkpoint 7 produces event 8 |
| Reconnect from consumed cursor | Subscription disconnect case uses the real `DaemonTraceSubscriptions`; local integration asserts wire cursors `[2,4]` and received sequences `[3,4,5,6,7]` |
| `closed` ends the workflow | Empty closed stream test, plus real daemon/API terminal push and native `RUN_FINISHED` in local integration |
| Unknown type remains unchanged | Subscription/timeline raw-object and complete-payload assertions; integration's `future.widget` native event |
| Tool results crossing a checkpoint remain visible | Timeline failure/cancellation cases consume only new events and reuse the acknowledged invocation's stable ID, without re-sending its start; real daemon/API integration carries a failed tool result as the first event after reconnect |
| No connector gap backfill | Connector calls only `subscribeTrace`; prerequisite `trace.test.ts` covers internal `trace.fetch` for gaps |
| No 400 ms messages/status polling | Local integration asserts zero messages GETs, no status reads before closed, exactly one final status GET |

Other successful local checks: `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run docs:test`
(13 tests), `npm run docs:check`, API snapshot check, and CLI capability checker
(678 mapped / 70 exempt / 0 missing / 748 routes).

`bun test tests/unit/multiremi/multiremi-delegation-result-comment-once.test.ts`
completed with **12 pass, 0 fail, 12 existing Postgres skips**. The local host has
no Postgres server or Docker; the corresponding Postgres cases must run in CI.
See `delegation-fixture-tests.log`.

The broader prerequisite regression also completed with **1129 pass, 0 fail**:

```sh
bun test tests/arch/ tests/unit/daemon/ tests/integration/daemon-protocol-v2/ \

```

After the Hub parent merge, wiring/role/terminal/integration regressions completed
with **48 pass, 0 fail, 12 existing Postgres skips** across five files. Hub core,
regressions, trace contract, sequence origin, architecture isolation, Feishu host
and trace subscription tests completed with **170 pass, 0 fail** across seven
files. The local integration record was regenerated on that combined tree.

## Mutation Tests

Actual source mutations, not simulated expectations:

1. Pass `throughSeq + 1` to `daemon.subscribeTrace`: the consumed checkpoint
   test fails, receiving `[5,6]` instead of `[4,5,6]`. See `mutation-cursor.log`.
2. Remove the `closed` branch: the empty closed stream test fails with
   `TimeoutError`. See `mutation-closed.log`.

Both mutations were reverted; all five subscription tests passed again.

## Local Integration

```sh
MULTIREMI_TEST_MUL447_EVIDENCE_PATH=.mul447-evidence/step1-local-integration.json \
  bun test tests/integration/feishu-trace-subscription.test.ts
```

Result: **1 pass, 0 fail**, 18 assertions. Real local Bun API, real co-resident
daemon, real sockets and temporary SQLite/outbox/trace state. The provider trace
and Feishu sender are simulated; no real Feishu message was sent. All services
and temporary data are disposed by the harness.

The JSON and self-contained HTML record native CoT events, trace subscription
RPCs, and local HTTP method/path pairs. No headers, tokens or credentials are
recorded. Checkpoint 2 receives 3; after consuming 4 and disconnecting, wire
cursor 4 resumes at 5. Received `[3,4,5,6,7]`; event 5 is a failed result for
the tool started at event 4, with the same display ID, one `TOOL_CALL_START` and
one `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`. Final checkpoint 7; `closed` ends the stream on the
existing native message.

## Item 5 Gap

`subscribeHumanRequests` is API-process local in the Hub interface; the concrete
Hub from MUL-436 (#308, now merged into the parent) is also API-process local.
The connector lives with
`MultiremiDaemon`, in another process. `task.human_request.settled` appears in
the daemon protocol vocabulary, but `agent/MUL-421` has no producer or receiver
for this push. No existing cross-process E5/Hub event subscription is available
to the connector. Wiring that existing transport is required before removing
the interaction lane's 750 ms loop.

Therefore `apps/remi/cli/multiremi.ts` retains its human-request `sleep(750)`.
The two presenter `delay(750, signal)` waits also remain; the same event-transport
gap prevents replacing them with a cross-process subscription.
This CoT fixture has no human requests: its zero human-request GET count does
**not** prove item 5 complete. No new protocol API or contracts change was added.

## Repository Search

Repository code search found no `pollFeishuTask` or
`listFeishuBotTaskMessages` references. No `sleep(400)` remains in the connector;
two unrelated `Bun.sleep(400)` calls in task-steer test synchronization are out
of scope. The one `sleep(750)` above is deliberately retained and reported.
Old routes/frames from steps 2 and 3 remain outside this change.

## CI Baseline

At pushed head `242dd531`, Developer context (Ubuntu/Windows), Session Archive
(Ubuntu/macOS), frontend-zero-jump and frontend-replica passed. Release build
check `build` failed at `tests/arch/api-role-resolution.test.ts`: it finds
`resolveApiRole` in `apps/remi/cli/multiremi.ts` and a role env read in
`packages/server/src/store/db/read-pool.ts`. Both came unchanged from the
parent/main MUL-462 line. MUL-436 step 3a owns the parent/main synchronization
and its single fix; this branch must not duplicate it. CI for the final tool
checkpoint commit must be checked separately after push.

Production 209 and Wiki were not modified. No deployment, branch switching,
default-branch push, or PR merge was performed.
