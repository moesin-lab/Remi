/**
 * The pure verdict half of the MUL-394 zero-jump check.
 *
 * The check's job is to fail CI the moment a page moves during load. On main
 * today several `key::mode` rows are *known* to violate (MUL-403's C8/C9/C9b
 * own the fixes, and nothing writes `data-perf-state` yet), so a hard gate
 * would be red from the first commit and protect nothing. Instead main carries
 * a reviewed allowlist of debt: one row per known-failing `key::mode`, naming
 * exactly which violation kinds it is allowed to show. Everything outside that
 * list fails immediately, and the listed kinds may only shrink.
 *
 * Kept pure and separate from the driver so the four rules below are unit
 * tested without a browser, a build or a server.
 *
 * Rules, in the order the review names them:
 *   a. A row that is not listed and violates → fail.
 *   b. A listed row that shows a kind it did not list → fail.
 *   c. A listed kind that does not appear in any of the repetitions → fail,
 *      telling the reader to drop the kind (and the row once it is empty).
 *      Partial appearances (2 of 3) do not trip this: only 0 of N does.
 *   d. `--strict` ignores the allowlist: every row is judged by rule a.
