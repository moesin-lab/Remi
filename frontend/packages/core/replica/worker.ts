/**
 * The DedicatedWorker that owns the replica's SQLite database (MUL-403 C7 §2).
 *
 * `sqlite-wasm` over `opfs-sahpool`: the official build, the official VFS, and
 * the reason this is a Worker at all — `createSyncAccessHandle()` exists only off
 * the main thread (the main thread has no `FileSystemFileHandle.prototype.
 * createSyncAccessHandle`, which is also why the API cannot be used from a page),
 * and a synchronous write on the page's thread is a jank source the plan exists
 * to remove.
 *
 * Two things this file does NOT do, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **no network.** The page holds the WebSocket because the token is in
 *   `localStorage` and a Worker cannot read it. The page forwards frames.
 * - **no timers.** A background tab's timers are throttled, so the replay, the
 *   patch and the coverage bookkeeping all run on message arrival.
 *
 * OPFS unavailable (old Safari, private mode, a store denied at runtime) is not
 * an error: the plan's fallback is the same protocol over memory, which is
 * {@link MemoryReplicaStorage} behind the same {@link ReplicaEngine}.
