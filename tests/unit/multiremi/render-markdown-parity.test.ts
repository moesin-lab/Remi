/**
 * `renderMarkdown` must produce the HTML the browser already produces for the
 * same markdown.
 *
 * MUL-439 asks for a snapshot comparison against the frontend's current
 * rendering over 20 representative inputs (code blocks, tables, math, mentions,
 * inline HTML, oversized fences). The reference is the real component: this
 * test renders `frontend/packages/ui/markdown` through `react-dom/server` and
 * compares it with the server's output for the same markdown.
 *
 * Why it is a structural rather than byte comparison:
 *
 * - The interactive chrome legitimately exists only in the browser. `CodeBlock`
 *   renders a language header, a copy button and a tooltip; the server cannot,
 *   because those need event handlers, and the client attaches them after
 *   injecting `body_html` (plan 3/6 §3). The fenced block itself — the Shiki
 *   `<pre>` the client would inject — is compared in full.
 * - The browser's own `div.markdown-content` wrapper is React's container;
 *   `EntryHtml` supplies an equivalent container, so it is dropped on the
 *   browser side only.
 *
 * Everything else has to match exactly: same elements, same nesting, same text,
 * same link targets. That is what "the first paint does not move" requires,
 * because `body_html` is what paints before hydration.
 *
 * `render-markdown-compare.ts` holds the normaliser; the fixtures are in
 * `render-markdown-fixtures.ts`.
