# ADR 0010: Recover terminal model failures from ACP bridge metadata

## Status

Accepted for MUL-478. Implements the decision in issue comment
`cmt_uuiy9i1f4fp3` and the native compaction recovery refinement in
`cmt_n5vqhlx6rone`; retains MUL-336's single model switch per recovery chain.

## Context

The pinned Codex ACP bridge can emit a terminal gateway error as assistant text
and resolve `session/prompt` with `end_turn`. The daemon then completes a task
whose final text is a model-not-supported error, moves the issue to `in_review`,
and bypasses failure recovery. Earlier progress makes whole-output heuristics
particularly unreliable.

Claude ACP rejects failed turns, but its error detail lives in JSON-RPC
`error.data`, which the client previously discarded. Model lookup errors can
also mention lack of access and be mistaken for an authentication failure.

Both pinned bridges already support JetBrains AIR `sessionFailure` metadata.
They advertise it in top-level `InitializeResult._meta`, not under
`agentCapabilities`. Claude's native `/compact` failure is a separate exit:
`tool_call_update(status=failed, _meta.contextCompaction.error)` followed by
`end_turn`, without an AIR error.
Their categories are broad (for example Claude uses `request` for both an
invalid request and model lookup), so categories alone cannot determine Remi's
recovery policy. Keep the original title/details and RPC `errorKind` as well.

The queued capability observer previously only explained waiting after two
minutes and recorded an analytics alert after fifteen minutes. It never used
the configured fallback even when a candidate Runtime supported it.

## Decision

1. The ACP client advertises AIR `sessionFailure` to both bridges and records
   whether both sides negotiated support using `InitializeResult._meta`;
   nested `agentCapabilities._meta` is only a compatibility fallback.
   `AcpProvider` consumes the failure metadata
   from `session_info_update` and `PromptResult`. Error severity throws
   `AcpSessionFailureError`, using the daemon's existing exception path.
   Warning severity does not fail the turn. Failure state resets for every
   prompt and notifications for other sessions are ignored.
   Independently of AIR negotiation, a failed context compaction tool also
   fails the prompt, retaining its error as details. Only assistant text after
   that failure in the same prompt clears it and logs a recovery warning;
   earlier output, compaction banners and thinking do not clear it. This does
   not clear independent AIR errors or treat ordinary failed tools as fatal.
2. Preserve JSON-RPC error data for structured classification, but exclude it
   from JSON serialization. Append only string `errorKind`, `message` and
   `details` fields (or legacy string data), redact credential patterns before
   truncating the appended text to 500 characters. Failure classification prefers known
   structured error kinds, then uses text. Model unavailability precedes auth;
   HTTP status matching excludes request IDs and UUID fragments.
   Availability text must describe the model itself, not an unsupported input
   feature. Generic `invalid_request_error` wrappers classify as invalid input
   only with no HTTP error status or exclusively 400, after specific provider
   causes such as authentication, quota, rate limits and server errors.
   Other HTTP error statuses retain their own classification. Code-less input
   failures remain supported; context-overflow markers are unchanged.

   One ACP redactor (`redactProviderErrorText`) protects RPC, typed failure
   objects and their causes, native failed-compaction events, and legacy
   terminal error messages. The daemon's `redactTaskError` applies it again
   before failure reports, logs and terminal progress. Typed failure copies
   are sanitized, and raw classification hints stay non-enumerable. The
   redaction contract (ruling `cmt_yufkv0in1pc2`) guarantees exactly three
   things:

   - Configured credentials are replaced by value anywhere in the text. These
     are the task's relay and auth tokens, plus provider environment values
     whose name has a `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`, `ACCESS_KEY`,
     `PRIVATE_KEY` or `CREDENTIAL` segment. Values shorter than 8 characters
     after trimming are skipped. Raw, Base64, Base64url and URL-encoded forms
     are covered, including the `+` and lowercase-hex variants.
   - Known formats: `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie` and
     `Set-Cookie` header values; the token after `Bearer` or `Basic`; URL
     user info; `sk-` keys; `ghp_`/`gho_` tokens; three-part JWTs.
   - Values of sensitive keys. A key is sensitive when, after up to three
     `%XX` decodes, camel-case splitting and lowercasing, it ends in
     `api_key`, `apikey`, `key`, `token`, `secret`, `password`, `passwd`,
     `passphrase`, `credential(s)`, `session`, `session_id`, `sid`, `auth`,
     `authorization` or `cookie`, and is followed by `:` or `=` (escaped
     quotes allowed). A quoted value is replaced up to the closing quote at
     the same escape level, or to the end of the line if unclosed. A `{}` or
     `[]` container is replaced up to its matching close, or to the end of the
     text if unclosed. A bare value is replaced for one word, which ends at
     whitespace, a quote, a backtick, one of `,;&{}[]` or an escaped quote.
     The only exception: when the character before the value is a space and
     the whole word is a 4xx/5xx status (optionally followed by one `.` or
     `:`), the word is kept for failure classification.

   Out of scope, and recorded by QA as observations rather than defects:
   unlabeled text after a bare value's terminator; configured credentials
   shorter than 8 characters, which rely on the format and key rules; a
   status separated from an empty sensitive field by a tab or newline, which
   is replaced; escaped forms such as `401\"`, which the classifier cannot
   read even before redaction.
3. For bridges without negotiated support, the daemon checks only the final
   emitted message in a naturally completed turn. It must be a short text
   message beginning with a known Codex transport error prefix and classify as
   a provider/model failure. Earlier progress cannot hide this final error.
   Bridges with typed support use structured metadata, including native
   compaction failures, as the failure authority.
4. The fallback set includes account-pool exhaustion, quota exhaustion, model
   unavailability, provider server errors and `queued_model_unavailable`.
   Rate limiting/overload (429/529) still retries the same model with bounded
   delay. Auth/configuration/network and other existing reasons retain their
   previous recovery policies. Every chain can switch only once; switching
   discards the old provider session and frozen model profile.
5. After five minutes of capability waiting, a queued task may fail with
   `queued_model_unavailable` only when it has attempts and switch budget left
   and a structurally eligible candidate supports its configured fallback.
   The observer uses the existing candidate/placement restrictions, including
   pinned runtimes. A shared `fallbackSwitchPlan` preflights recovery.
   Failure plus retry creation is atomic under the workspace lifecycle lock,
   with a guarded queued update. Events publish after commit. A missing retry
   rolls back the transition. Ineligible tasks retain their fifteen-minute
   alert. Age follows the observer's existing task creation timestamp.
6. Record switches using the existing `gateway_resource:` reason prefix and
   `fallbackSwitched`. The execution view gives model, server and queue reasons
   their own labels. No new API or CLI command is required.

## Alternatives Considered

- Whole-output text detection loses the bridge's known turn outcome, can
  mistake diagnostic prose for a failure and misses errors after long output.
  Keep text matching only as a compatibility fallback for older bridges.
- Forking both upstream bridges to add a new stop reason duplicates an existing
  capability and adds dependency maintenance work.
- Mutating the queued task's model in place or redispatching it would duplicate
  recovery/session cleanup, delegation suppression and switch accounting.
  Terminal failure followed by a retry reuses those policies and creates an
  auditable timeline record.
- Keeping fallback limited to account/quota exhaustion leaves unavailable
  models and compaction 5xx incidents stranded despite a configured backup.

## Consequences and Verification

Typed errors no longer enter assistant output as successful results. Failed
attempts use existing issue-state and delegation-return handling; a retry keeps
the issue in progress, and only the end of the chain wakes the delegator.

A gateway-wide 5xx can spend one extra attempt on the fallback. The single
switch and attempt limits bound this cost. Old bridge text matching retains a
limited ambiguity when a legitimate final answer is exactly a transport error.
Queue failure records are intentional and expose why the model changed.

Regression entry points are `tests/unit/acp/session-failure.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/acp/provider-error-redaction.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/multiremi/multiremi-task-failure.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/multiremi/agent-model-fallback-recovery.test.ts` and
`tests/integration/agent-model-fallback-drill.test.ts`. The drill isolates the
model process while exercising the real API/daemon/store chain. It does not
prove production gateway behavior or imply deployment authorization.

Rollback removes the two AIR capability declarations and reverts the fallback
policy/queue observer changes. The legacy daemon detector remains independently
available for sessions without negotiated capability support.
