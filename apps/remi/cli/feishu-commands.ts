/**
 * Feishu bot slash-command routing (MUL-358).
 *
 * The Feishu client renders a "stop" control on native CoT messages. Pressing
 * it does not call the app: the client sends an ordinary IM text message as the
 * user — `/stop` in a single chat, `@bot /stop` in a group — so the platform
 * must recognise it in the inbound path exactly like `/help`. Text that is not
 * recognised as a command continues to the normal Task path.
 *
 * Commands are matched against the *raw* message content. The connector's
 * `text` carries presentation prefixes (`贺华杰: ` in groups, `[Replying to: …]`
 * for quoted replies), which is why matching on it previously made every
 * command in a group miss and fall through to Task creation.
