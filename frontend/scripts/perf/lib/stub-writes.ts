/**
 * The write guard's explicit allow-list, and the response rewrite that makes the
 * allowed writes terminate.
 *
 * The probe runs against production read-only: every non-GET/HEAD `/api/**`
 * request is aborted inside `page.route()`. That guarantee stays. What changed is
 * that one endpoint is now *stubbed* rather than aborted, because aborting it does
 * not simulate a user — it creates a failure loop that the app never leaves:
 *
 *  - `inbox-page.tsx` auto-marks the selected notification read through
 *    `useMarkInboxItemsRead` (`core/inbox/mutations.ts`), which optimistically
 *    sets `read: true`, and on error restores the cache and invalidates the inbox.
 *  - A restored `read: false` makes the effect fire again, so one click produced
 *    55-100 aborted `POST /api/inbox/:id/read` calls and delayed the URL commit
 *    from 181ms to ~5s (measured on 209, MUL-384 `cmt_cxrxocj4vp3q`).
 *
 * Stubbing the POST alone is not enough: the mutation has no `onSuccess`, so the
 * loop only ends when the next `/api/inbox/page` response reports `read: true` for
 * that item. That is `rewriteInboxReadState` below. Nothing leaves the browser —
 * the stub fulfills inside the page's own route handler, so the server still sees
 * no writes at all.
