/**
 * The replica's SQLite schema (MUL-403 C7 §4).
 *
 * One database file per `(user_id, workspace_id)`, path
 * `remi-replica/<user>/<ws>.sqlite3`, so two workspaces of the same user never
 * share a file and two users of the same workspace never share a file either.
 * Six tables, and each one exists because a specific reader needs it:
 *
 * | table | why it is a table and not a column |
 * |---|---|
 * | `entries` | the rows the window renders, keyed by `(session_id, seq)` |
 * | `revision_watermarks` | highest accepted revision, retained after deletion/hiding |
 * | `ranges` | a deep-link window is sparse, so coverage is many ranges, not one `head` |
 * | `heads` | `head_seq` + `log_version` is the freshness token, and the resume cursor |
 * | `row_heights` | measured heights, keyed per variant and width bucket |
 * | `meta` | schema version and `user_id`, i.e. the two cleanup triggers |
 *
 * `heads.head_seq` is nullable on purpose: `NULL` means "an ack has arrived but no
 * row has been written yet", which is different from seq 0 (a real seq for an
 * empty session) and from having no row at all. Coercing it to 0 is what makes a
 * stale window look fresh, because the next comparison is against the server's
 * own head.
 *
 * `ranges` is what makes `head` meaningful: `head` is the newest contiguous run,
 * not the newest row, so the table stores coverage explicitly instead of the
 * reader inferring it from the rows it happens to see (a deleted hidden marker
 * leaves a hole in `entries` without leaving one in reality).
 */

/**
 * Bump on any change to the statements below.
 *
 * A mismatch is not migrated: the leader deletes the whole database and
 * re-subscribes, which is correct because the replica is a cache and a migration
 * would be a second implementation of the log's own schema evolution (plan 3/6
 * §1.6 lists schema upgrade among the full-clear triggers).
