/**
 * Server-side sink for the daemon's live trace stream (MUL-401 §5).
 *
 * The path is: daemon TraceStore -> `trace.append` frame -> this interface ->
 * MUL-403's Live Hub -> `subscribe(taskId, fromSeq)` for browsers, Feishu CoT and
 * SSR. A-0 defines the seam and ships an in-memory implementation that A-6 wires
 * into the connection layer; C implements the real one.
 *
 * The one invariant that matters: the sequence on the wire is the daemon's
 * `trace_seq`, passed through untouched. This layer must never renumber, because
 * C's `subscribe(fromSeq)` cursor and MUL-402's file offsets all speak the
 * daemon's numbering.
