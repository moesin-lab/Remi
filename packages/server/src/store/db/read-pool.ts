/**
 * The asynchronous read path: a dedicated read-only `Bun.SQL` pool.
 *
 * MUL-383's binding constraints (issue MUL-383, decision `sres_wep8c9z66cef`,
 * restated for MUL-403 in `cmt_u3fltd47w6r0`) require new server-side read
 * paths — SSR first paint, Live Hub warm-up — to use an async direct connection
 * instead of the synchronous Worker/Atomics bridge in `store/db/postgres.ts`.
 * The bridge is what turns a slow read into a stalled event loop; the pool
 * keeps reads off the main thread and bounds what they can cost.
 *
 * ## Threat model, and what this gate is for
 *
 * The pool only ever runs SQL that server-side code wrote. It is not an
 * ad-hoc query console, and no caller may put user data into the statement
 * text: parameters go through `$n` bindings, which the driver sends out of
 * band. The gate below is a **default-deny guard against developer mistakes** —
 * a query that quietly gains a function call with an effect, a copy-pasted
 * statement that is not a read at all.
 *
 * It is explicitly **not** a sandbox for hostile SQL. A determined author with
 * the ability to write arbitrary statements can reach a function nobody put on
 * the whitelist only if that name is spelled in the same lower-case form the
 * whitelist uses, but the honest statement of the boundary is this: the real
 * protection for hostile SQL is database permissions on the role the pool
 * connects with — `REVOKE EXECUTE` on the functions it does not need, no
 * `dblink`/`postgres_fdw`, no `pg_read_server_files`. Those changes belong to
 * the production role on 209 and are tracked separately by the squad lead; they
 * are not something this file can do.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * - `max: 4` connections;
 * - a client-side abort at 3 s, so a statement the server never times out (a
 *   lock wait reported as `SELECT`, a hung socket) still returns to the caller;
 * - a queue cap of 64; the 65th waiter fails immediately with
 *   `read_pool_saturated`, which the routers map to 503 so the caller can fall
 *   back (SSR renders the shell, the replica fetches) instead of piling up;
 * - SQL text goes through `translateSqliteToPg`, so call sites keep emitting
 *   the sqlite dialect the store is written in and each statement has one copy;
 * - on SQLite (the default local backend) this degrades to the synchronous
 *   library, where an async pool would only add latency.
 *
 * ## The two layers, and which one covers what
 *
 * **Layer 1 — every statement runs in its own `BEGIN READ ONLY` transaction**
 * with `SET LOCAL statement_timeout`. This is the layer that stops *writes*.
 * The transaction mode is fixed when it opens, so a session default changed by
 * an earlier statement cannot reopen it; `SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE` would,
 * and is rejected by the classifier as a `SET`. `SET LOCAL` is
 * transaction-scoped, so a disarmed session setting cannot lift the timeout and
 * the timeout cannot outlive the transaction.
 *
 * **Layer 2 — a default-deny function whitelist.** A read-only transaction does
 * not stop every function. `pg_notify` delivers, `pg_advisory_lock` leaves a
 * lock behind, `pg_terminate_backend` kills another connection, `nextval`
 * advances a sequence, `lo_export` and `pg_read_file` touch the filesystem, and
 * `dblink_exec` runs a statement on a *different* connection where this
 * transaction's read-only mode does not apply. Those are refused before the
 * statement is sent: {@link scanSqlFunctionCalls} resolves every call the way
 * PostgreSQL resolves it, and {@link findDisallowedFunction} rejects anything
 * that is not on {@link READ_FUNCTION_WHITELIST}.
 *
 * Why a whitelist and not the earlier denylist: two rounds of review
 * (`cmt_u0bywkppcajq`, `cmt_w08j1ocyurc6`) broke a denylist twice, once with
 * `pg_catalog.set_config` and once with `"set_config"` — PostgreSQL accepts a
 * quoted spelling of every function name, so a list of forbidden names cannot
 * be completed. Enumerating what is *known safe* fails closed instead.
 *
 * Neither layer covers the other's gap, which is why both are here: the
 * transaction cannot stop `pg_notify` or an advisory lock, and the whitelist
 * cannot tell a write function (`SELECT my_write_fn()`) from a pure one — that
 * one only fails because the transaction it runs in is read-only.
