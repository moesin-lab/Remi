/**
 * EntryHtml — one log row whose body is already rendered (MUL-403 plan 3/6 §3).
 *
 * The component's whole job is to put `body_html` into the DOM and then attach
 * the enhancement `enhance.ts` produces. Two rules keep it from moving the page:
 *
 * 1. **The HTML is final.** It was sanitized by `renderMarkdown` on the server
 *    with the same schema the client uses, so nothing here re-parses markdown or
 *    re-highlights code. Re-rendering would be both slower and a second
 *    sanitizer to keep in sync.
 * 2. **The enhancement is height-neutral.** `enhanceEntryHtml` runs in a layout
 *    effect, before paint, and every element it adds is either absolutely
 *    positioned or a fixed-height slot; a preview therefore never resizes the
 *    row it lives in, however slowly Mermaid or the iframe resolves.
 *
 * SSR emits the sanitized markup. The memoized host stays identical when
 * preview portals mount, so React does not replace enhanced children.
 *
 * `body_html` empty is the degrade path the plan names (`degraded_render`): the
 * row reports it through `onDegradedRender` and renders `fallback`, which the
 * caller supplies because only it knows which client renderer to reach for.
