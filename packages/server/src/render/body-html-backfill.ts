/**
 * Idle backfill for `multiremi_conversation_log.body_html`.
 *
 * B1 (MUL-426) inserts conversation-log rows with `body_html` NULL, because the
 * renderer did not exist when the writer landed: the plan is explicit that the
 * column is filled here, after the fact, rather than by widening the write path
 * (MUL-402 `cmt_4dntxwh8ub1m`: "B1 先存 NULL，等 C 的
 * `renderMarkdown(md) → {html, render_version}` 就绪后再补").
 *
 * Three properties make this safe to run in the production API process:
 *
 * - **It does not start when the column is absent.** Other agents own the
 *   migration that creates `multiremi_conversation_log`; until it lands, this
 *   task logs once and stays stopped instead of failing its way through a log
 *   file. The probe re-runs on every start attempt, so a process that boots
 *   before B1 can still pick the work up after a restart.
 * - **It is idle.** Work runs in small batches with a pause between them, and a
 *   short batch means the next tick comes back for more. It never re-reads a
 *   row it just wrote, so a table with nothing to do costs one indexed query
 *   per pause.
 * - **It converges rather than racing.** A row is a candidate when `body_html`
 *   is NULL or when its `render_version` is not the current one, so bumping
 *   `RENDER_PIPELINE_REVISION` re-renders everything through the same path. The
 *   update is guarded by `(session_id, seq)`, which is the table's primary key.
 *
 * Rows are re-read every tick rather than tracked in memory: the table is the
 * only source of truth, a restart resumes exactly where it left off, and a
 * concurrent writer that fills a row itself simply removes it from the next
 * candidate set.
