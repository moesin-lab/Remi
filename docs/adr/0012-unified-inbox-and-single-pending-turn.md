# ADR 0012: Unified inbox on the conversation log, one pending turn per lane, wakes commit with state

- Status: accepted (MUL-404, 2026-09-28; amended by MUL-492; supersedes the per-path coalescing in ADR 0005 decisions 3–6 and amends ADR 0003 decision 8)
- Deciders: 贺华杰 (scope), Senior大哥 (design), 带头大哥 (split)

## Context

被 ADR 0013 修订：消息、收件箱与轮的当前模型取代旧命令和任务入口；下文保留决策史实。

Three wake paths grew independently: delegation returns
(`drainDelegationReturnsWithinWorkspaceLock`), child terminal notifications
(MUL-400 E2), and comment mentions. Each has its own "find the queued task"
predicate, its own prompt-append coalescing, and its own lock coverage; the
predicates disagree (delegation ignores `continued_from_task_id`, E2 ignores
`projection_to_seq` and execution scope), and nothing in the database prevents
two queued rounds for the same agent on the same session. E2, the E3
notifications, and E4 run their wake in a post-commit hook that opens a second
transaction, so a process exit between the two commits loses the wake (ADR 0004
§5 "known crash window"). Agents wake to a JSONL projection with no table of
contents, no priority, and bodies cut at 4,000 characters.

MUL-402 B1 made `multiremi_conversation_log` the single per-session log, with
`multiremi_session_agent_lanes.cursor_seq` as each agent's read position
(ADR 0006). MUL-427 moved the wake readers onto that log. MUL-452 replays E3
automatic starts from `multiremi_system_events` and explicitly leaves the
notification wakes to this decision.

## Decision

1. **The inbox is the recipient's conversation log read from its lane cursor.**
   There is no inbox table. Every cross-agent message is an entry in the
   recipient's session log carrying `metadata.envelope` (`kind`, `wake`,
   `dedupe_key`, `reply_to`, `grant_ref`, `priority`, `source`). For symbolic
   `issue_owner`, `parent_owner`, and `delegator` addresses, the writer also
   stores the resolved `recipient_agent_id` so later ownership changes do not
   change delivery attribution. Issue re-ring uses that same frozen recipient;
   entries written before this field existed still resolve the current owner.
   On Issue
   sessions the entry is a system comment (`kind = system`); on chat sessions it
   is a system message. Delegation reports and decision answers, which today live
   only in task prompts or `session_events`, become such entries.
2. **`sendEnvelopeWithinTransaction` is the only writer.** It resolves the
   role address, dedupes by a deterministic entry id under the session head lock
   (no seq is allocated for a duplicate), appends the entry, and calls
   `ensurePendingTurnWithinTransaction`. E2, E3 failure/readiness notices, E4 and
   delegation returns call this writer. Comment mentions reuse the original
   comment's sequence and call `ensurePendingTurnWithinTransaction` directly;
   they do not create an envelope. Message content is never appended to a task prompt.
3. **The pending turn the platform plants is the queued `multiremi_tasks` row
   with a non-null `wake_source`, one per lane.** `multiremi_tasks.execution_scope`
   becomes a stored column. Two partial unique indexes enforce at most one
   `status = 'queued' AND wake_source IS NOT NULL AND continued_from_task_id IS NULL`
   row per `(issue_session_id, agent_id, execution_scope)` and per
   `(chat_session_id, agent_id)`. Rows a person plants - a Chat message, a
   member's comment round, `remi task create`, an API continuation - keep
   `wake_source` NULL, stay outside the indexes, and keep their queue semantics
   (Chat edit / reorder / remove, one round per human comment under Q-B answer 2).
   `ensurePendingTurn` still looks for *any* queued row in the lane before it
   creates one, so a platform wake rides a human round when one is queued; the
   index is the invariant for platform-planted rows, not the control flow.
4. **Platform wakes commit with the state change.** `ensurePendingTurn` asserts it is
   inside the caller's transaction. ADR 0003 decision 8 ("every guarded path runs
   at transaction depth 1") stands; what changes is what may remain post-commit:
   pushes (`emitCommitEvents`, `notifyTaskEnqueued`), the E3 automatic
   start (replayed by MUL-452), and deferred comments (decision 8). Crash
   injection before the turn write, after it, and after commit must observe
   either nothing or everything, on PostgreSQL and SQLite.
   Standalone comments and caller-owned comments (including Organizer audit
   comments) reuse the comment log sequence for mentions and non-split assignee wakes in the
   comment's frame. A failed wake rolls back the comment and its queued events.
   Classify comment dispatch by who can receive an error and retry, rather than
   by caller name. HTTP/CLI clients, Organizer action callers, delegation terminal
   reports retried by the daemon outbox, and Feishu retries deduped by
   `external_message_id` have a retry owner and use D1: dispatch and comment
   writes share one transaction and fail atomically. Platform-written replies
   under a must-not-fail contract without a retry owner (currently only the two
   call sites of `postAgentReplyComment`) use 402 F1: the reply and `final_entry_id`
   commit together, but mention dispatch and member notifications run after
   COMMIT. A dispatch SQL failure keeps the reply and completes the task with
   one warning. If automatic replies move into the `task.complete` report with
   outbox retries, switch them back to D1. The split assignee auto-response also
   opens its own transaction after COMMIT. A process exit between the two commits
   previously could lose either wake; decision 8 closes these gaps. Member
   notifications and realtime pushes also remain after COMMIT.
5. **`wake` has three meanings.** `now`: ensure a pending turn; if the turn ends
   with such entries still unread, ring again (re-ring). `next_turn`: no turn is
   created while one is queued or running; the entry rides along and never
   re-rings. `inbox_only`: never rings; it appears in the table of contents only.
   On a Chat lane there is no cursor and no re-ring: `now` rides a queued
   task, steers a running one in the same transaction, or creates a
   `wake_source = 'relay'` row; `next_turn` never creates.
6. **Receipts are best effort and coarse.** The claim response persists its
   projection boundaries on the task. An Issue turn card already exists, so a
   separate transaction patches its `metadata.inbox` after claim. A Chat turn
   card is the assistant reply itself (same id and seq); it is created only when
   that reply lands, then a separate transaction patches the saved boundaries.
   A missing Chat reply has no receipt. The patch contains `delivered_from_seq`,
   `delivered_to_seq`, `delivered_at`, and `task_id`; failure is logged without
   undoing the claim or reply. "Delivered" for a single entry is derived from
   the recipient lane cursor and turn coverage, never stored per entry. Coverage
   uses the receipt boundary even when a queued turn predates an envelope that
   later joins it.
7. **The unread projection gets a table of contents and folding.** Entries are
   ranked human decision > failed/stuck > done > notice, from
   `envelopePriority(entry)`; bodies over the fold threshold are summarised
   deterministically (head + heading outline) with an expand command instead of
   being cut.
8. **Deferred comment dispatch has a durable replay owner (MUL-492).** The
   comment transaction writes an `issue_comment / comment_dispatch` system event
   before COMMIT, available after 60 seconds. Normal post-commit dispatch takes
   W and consumes only a `pending` intent, then dispatches all targets in that
   same transaction. The existing 30-second system-events scheduler replays
   overdue intents using its lease, backoff and eight-attempt cap. Replay takes
   W and conditionally consumes `processing AND attempt_count = claimedAttempt`;
   zero changed rows mean no dispatch. Consumption, all turns and the success
   activity commit together; events follow COMMIT. A stale lease owner cannot
   dispatch or alter a newer attempt's retry state. Recipient resolution reuses
   the normal mention/assignee paths and never repeats member notifications.

   Edits and deletes persist `trigger_comment_changed` intents with comment ids
   and affected task/lane coordinates. They replay cancellation and recovery
   using those ids even when the original comment has been deleted. The
   `comment_missing`, 24-hour expiry and `MULTIREMI_COMMENT_DISPATCH_REPLAY`
   discard rules apply only to `comment_dispatch`; disabling replay does not
   suppress normal dispatch or stop intent writes. Discarded dispatch intents
   stay processed if the switch is re-enabled. Recovery records
   `re_ring { origin: trigger_comment_changed }`; replay success records
   `comment_dispatch_replayed { commentId, eventId, attempt, taskIds }`.
9. **Idle Issue lanes get a bounded periodic safety sweep (MUL-492).** The
   existing 60-second capability monitor runs independent jobs. Discovery first
   visits at most 50 lanes through a partial ordering index containing only
   `status = active AND wake_hint_seq > swept_to_seq`. Issue `now` envelope
   writes advance only the resolved recipient lane's `wake_hint_seq` in the same
   transaction. Lanes without pending hints incur no locks or writes; recovery
   latency depends on pending lanes, not total historical lanes. The upgrade
   conservatively hints heads beyond the existing cursor/watermark once, only
   for active non-relay lanes in active sessions with a non-archived agent in
   the same workspace. Sweep summaries distinguish visited and eligible lanes;
   a full page signals possible backlog without counting all pending lanes.
   Under W, each lane transaction rereads head, agent/session availability and
   tasks. Cursor-covered hints and permanently unavailable recipients (archived
   agents/sessions or relay scopes) advance the watermark to the hint and leave
   the index. Lanes blocked by an active task rotate without advancing their
   watermark, preserving pending work. Eligible lanes exclude
   queued/dispatched/running/waiting-local-directory/awaiting-human lanes, then
   read at most 500 shown entries in `(max(cursor_seq, swept_to_seq), head_seq]`.
   The recipient predicate is shared with turn-end re-ring. Only entries at
   least 60 seconds old are judged; the first young entry stops the watermark.
   Judged entries advance `swept_to_seq`, independent of cursor resets, preventing
   repeated wakes for a poison envelope while allowing new work to ring.

   Issue envelope delivery creates its recipient lane and writes its hint in the
   envelope transaction, including first delivery. Recovery goes through
   `ensurePendingTurnWithinTransaction` and normal route derivation, inheriting
   delegation lineage for nonempty scopes from the last task (or the newest task
   in that lane). Periodic, terminal and comment-change recovery share the same
   lineage extraction, including the original `parentTaskId` for scoped
   delegations. That upstream link resolves the return scope; the recovered
   round is not made a child of its replaced round. Unscoped/non-delegated
   parent behavior stays unchanged. It preserves Issue status and
   dependency-gate wake exemptions.
   W plus the existing pending-turn unique index arbitrate multiple instances;
   no extra lease, advisory lock or leader election is added for the sweep.
   `wakeSource` stays `re_ring`, with audit `origin: periodic_sweep`; ordinary
   terminal re-ring uses `origin: turn_end`. Lane SQL failures roll back before
   a separate diagnostic transaction; other lanes continue. Chat and relay
   lanes are excluded. `MULTIREMI_RE_RING_SWEEP` defaults on, as does the comment
   replay switch; `0/false/off/disabled` disables either. Additive columns and
   indexes can remain when rolling back the code.

## Consequences

- Four coalescing implementations and their prompt-append helpers are deleted.
  Skip/coalesce audit moves to `pending_turn_created | pending_turn_coalesced |
  pending_turn_skipped`; the lineage reasons in `DelegationSkipReason` stay.
- Under Q-B answer 1 (`HUMAN_COMMENT_JOINS_QUEUED_ROUND = true`) a human comment
  or mention while a round is queued for that lane joins it instead of creating
  a second queued task; editing the round's trigger comment cancels the round
  and, if other comments had joined, plants a `re_ring` turn in the same
  transaction. Under answer 2 every human comment keeps its own round, as
  today. Chat message queues are unchanged either way.
- A continuation task inherits `wake_source` from the task it continues and is
  excluded from the indexes by `continued_from_task_id IS NULL`; two queued
  continuations on one lane remain legal, as today.
- After an Issue turn completes or is cancelled, unread external `now` entries
  create or coalesce a `re_ring` task in the same terminal transaction. Chat
  has no cursor and uses steering instead. At claim time, a queued Issue task
  with non-null `wake_source` is cancelled as `already_covered` only when its
  lane cursor covers `wake_seq` and no unread `now` entry remains. Rows with
  null `wake_source` are always claimable. Requeued tasks clear their projection
  range and mode so the next claim projects newly arrived entries.
- Delegation reports and decision answers become visible system comments in the
  recipient session.
- The migration collapses existing duplicate queued rows (keeps the oldest,
  appends the newer prompts, cancels the newer rows) before creating the indexes.
- The relay agent (转述 Remi) reads the Issue log through a lane of its own
  (`execution_scope = relay:<chat_session_id>`) instead of the latest-only
  aggregate in `multiremi_agent_issue_update_state`; that table is dropped after
  the v2 switch-over, not here.
- Until this lands, the E2/E4 crash window from ADR 0004 §5 remains and is
  covered by the parent's per-round inventory of children.

## Alternatives considered

A separate inbox table; a separate pending-turn table; the Live Hub as the
wake carrier; `multiremi_system_events` replay for E2/E4; a new log kind
`envelope`. All rejected for the reasons in the MUL-404 plan §5.
