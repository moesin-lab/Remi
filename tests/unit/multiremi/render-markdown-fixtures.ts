/**
 * The 20 representative markdown inputs for the `renderMarkdown` parity check.
 *
 * MUL-439 splits them by the features called out in the acceptance criteria:
 * fenced code (with and without a language), tables, math (inline and display),
 * mentions (both the modern link form and the legacy shortcode), inline HTML
 * (allowed, then hostile), oversized fences, and the ordinary prose that most
 * rows actually contain.
 *
 * They are data, not test code, so the parity test reads as one loop and the
 * list is easy to extend when a new rendering feature lands.
 *
 * **What the 20 cases actually prove, precisely**: 19 of them are compared
 * structurally against the browser component (same elements, nesting, text and
 * link targets, with the client-only chrome normalised away by
 * `render-markdown-compare.ts`). The 20th — the oversized fence — is a
 * *documented divergence*: the server keeps a plain `<pre>` while the browser
 * highlights after its async pass, so it asserts the downgrade and the shared
 * code text instead of a structure match. The highlighting that the 19 do not
 * cover byte-for-byte is pinned separately, byte for byte, by the dedicated
 * "fenced block is byte-identical" case in the parity test.
