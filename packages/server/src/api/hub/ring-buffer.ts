/**
 * Retention for the Live Hub (MUL-403 §1, C1 / MUL-436).
 *
 * Two ordered streams share this layer and nothing about their payloads:
 * `log:<session_id>` frames carry a conversation-log row's own `seq`,
 * `trace:<task_id>` frames the daemon's `trace_seq`. The hub assigns no sequence
 * of its own, so a ring is a window over somebody else's numbering and the only
 * thing this file decides is how much of that window stays resident.
 *
 * Three budgets, from ADR 0007 and plan 2/6 §1:
 *
 *   - one stream holds at most 1024 frames **or** 4 MiB, whichever bites first;
 *   - every stream together hold at most 128 MiB;
 *   - past the global budget the ring evicts whole streams that have no
 *     subscriber and have not been touched for 15 minutes, oldest first.
 *
 * Eviction only shortens replay. A stream that was evicted is a cold stream
 * again, and a subscriber asking for a range the ring no longer holds is
 * answered with a `gap` so it can read the range from the route that owns it
 * (the browser from the log window endpoints, A-6 from `trace.fetch`). Nothing
 * here ever reads a database: filling a hole is the hub's job, and the hub does
 * it through an injected reader.
 *
 * Frames are serialized **once**, on the way in, and the ring keeps that string
 * next to the frame. Fan-out and `/health`'s ring occupancy both use the string's
 * real byte length rather than guessing from object shape, and one frame costs
 * one serialization however many subscribers it reaches.
