# CLI command migration

`remi issue decision request <source-issue> --kind <kind> --title <title>
[--body-stdin] [--option <choice>...]` records a non-blocking decision on the
source issue's parent (or on the source issue itself when it has no parent).
The requesting task can end its current round after the command returns. The
parent owner agent answers with `remi issue decision answer <parent> <decision>
--text <answer> --reason <why> --overturn <how>`, or hands it to a member with
`remi issue decision escalate <parent> <decision>`. Members can answer or revise
any decision. `remi issue decision list <parent>` shows the waiting-on-human and
owner/answered groups; `remi issue decision withdraw <parent> <decision>` removes
an unanswered request. The answer record ID must be cited as `decision:<id>` in
subsequent work.

This document is the user-facing migration contract for the Registry-based Remi CLI.
The machine-readable source of truth remains `cli-capabilities.json`; CI checks this
table against that manifest.

`remi issue rerun <issue> --task-id <task>` retries a failed or cancelled execution
with its original Agent, Session and instructions. The task must belong to the Issue
and be visible to the caller. An active Issue run returns `409 active_run_exists`;
unfinished prerequisites return `409 dependencies_unmet`. This explicit retry cannot
combine `--task-id` with `--agent-id` or `--prompt`, and does not force past prerequisites.
Without `--task-id`, the existing rerun behavior and overrides remain available.

`remi issue status-pages --statuses todo,in_progress --limit 50
--include-archived-total --output json` calls `GET /api/issues/status-pages`.
The response is `{ groups: { [status]: { issues, total, has_more } },
archived_total? }`. Each bucket contains the same compatibility Issue records
and total as `/api/issues?status=...&limit=...&offset=0`. Default statuses are
all seven server statuses, including `cancelled`; `open` normalizes to `todo`.
The default limit is 50 per status, capped at 500. Only offset 0 is accepted;
continue each bucket through the existing `/api/issues` route.

`remi issue grouped --include-archived-total --output json` also opts into
the workspace-wide `archived_total` for assignee boards. Omitting the flag
preserves the existing response and avoids the additional archive count.

The API reuses the compatibility list query: `workspace_id`, `statuses`/`status`,
`priorities`/`priority`, `assignee_types`, `assignee_id`, `assignee_ids`,
`project_id`, `project_ids`, `parent_id`, `top_level_only`, `metadata` (JSON
equality filters), `include_no_assignee`, `include_no_project`, `include_archived`,
`archived_only`, `limit`, and `offset`. Lists are comma-separated. CLI options
use `--workspace`, `--statuses`/`--status`, `--priority`, `--assignee-type`,
`--assignee`, `--assignee-ids`, `--project`, `--project-ids`, `--parent`,
`--metadata`, and hyphenated forms of the Boolean flags. Assignee references
use the shared resolver, including user IDs, member IDs, Agent IDs and names.
The compatibility list query also accepts the legacy `assignee_type` spelling
when `assignee_types` is absent; the plural takes precedence, including when
empty. Native queries retain `assigneeTypes`/`assignee_types` only. The CLI sends
`assignee_types` for `--assignee-type`.
Like the existing list, ordering is `updated_at DESC`; `sort_by`, `sort_order`,
`creator_id` and `involves_user_id` currently have no effect.

`remi issue children <key-or-id>` accepts either reference. Both children batch
routes resolve `parent_ids` to parent IDs and deduplicate those IDs before
listing children. A full issue ID resolves globally, whatever workspace is
selected, so the CLI's default `X-Workspace-ID` never hides a parent the caller
can access; the workspace only distinguishes keys, numbers and ID prefixes.
For those, explicit workspace selectors take precedence in this order: query
`workspace_id` (native requests first check `workspaceId`, then `workspace_id`),
`X-Workspace-ID`, then `X-Workspace-Slug` resolved to a workspace ID. An unknown
explicit slug skips keys, numbers and prefixes but still resolves full IDs. With
no explicit selector, resolution remains unscoped and does not infer token or
member defaults. Non-ID references follow `getIssueByRef`, like
`/api/issues/:id/children`: a unique match wins, or, without a workspace
selector, the unique local row takes precedence among multiple matches. An
explicit workspace restricts resolution to that workspace's row. Unknown or
still unresolved references and inaccessible parents are skipped; children must
also pass the existing workspace access check. Compatibility responses retain
snake_case Issue fields, while native responses retain camelCase.

`include_archived_total=true` (CLI `--include-archived-total`) adds the
workspace-wide archived count, independent of other list filters. Omission
performs no archive count query and omits the field. Buckets, totals, labels
and the optional count share a SQLite read transaction or a PostgreSQL
read-only Repeatable Read transaction. The Web pages do not call this API yet.

Agent creation, editing and default-agent commands accept `--provider antigravity`.
`remi daemon start --provider antigravity` selects the native `agy` runtime;
automatic daemon discovery also detects it. Install/sign in to agy on the daemon
machine first. See [Antigravity Runtime](antigravity.md) for model discovery,
configuration and execution limits. Agent Plugin provider filters remain scoped
to Claude/Codex.

`remi agent create|update|template create` accept `--fallback-model <model>` and
`--fallback-thinking-level <level>`. The backup must differ from the primary
model and be executable on the same selected target; its reasoning level must
belong to the backup model's catalog. Use `remi agent update <agent>
--fallback-model ''` to clear the backup. Changing an Agent's provider, Runtime,
execution group or workspace clears the saved backup unless supplied again.

`remi agent create`, `remi agent template create <template>`, `remi agent update
<agent>` and `remi agent default` accept `--execution-group <group-id>`.
Use `remi runtime group list` to find groups and their online Runtime counts,
then `remi runtime model catalog --execution-group <group-id>` to inspect models.
Create and maintain groups explicitly with `remi runtime group create|update`
and a JSON body containing `name`, `provider`, `profile_id` (or null), and
`runtime_ids`. Optional `description` organizes groups; optional `connection`
contains `name`, `profile`, and a write-only `api_key` to save the provider and
models atomically with membership. The provider is inherited from the group.
With `connection`, null `profile_id` creates a reusable connection; an existing
ID updates that shared connection for all referencing groups. Omitting
`connection` leaves it unchanged. Discovery no longer creates groups. A Runtime can belong to several
groups in its workspace; provider compatibility is checked. Existing legacy groups
and bindings are retained on upgrade. See [execution configuration](dev/execution-configuration.md).

The legacy `--runtime <runtime-id>` agent and model-catalog option remains
supported, and is mutually exclusive with `--execution-group`. Omitting both
on agent update preserves the existing target. The provider is inferred from
the selected target unless explicitly supplied; an explicit provider must match.
Tasks use eligible members of the selected group and wait when none is available;
they do not fall back to unrelated Runtimes sharing a provider.

`remi runtime model catalog --agent <agent-id> --json` returns the same selectable
models and reasoning capabilities as the Agent editor. For the Codex gateway,
`model_catalog_status: "ready"` means `models` is the authoritative execution
catalog. A saved model absent from that list is not executable; its saved model
and thinking level remain intact. New selections of that model return
`model_not_in_execution_catalog`. `model_catalog_status: "error"` retains the
ordinary gateway inventory and reports capability loading failure instead of
emptying the picker. Each model's `execution_status` distinguishes `available`,
`unavailable`, and `unknown`; only actual ACP fallback members stay executable
when that Runtime cannot load the native catalog. Bundled GPT reasoning options
remain usable. `model_catalog_status: "unknown"` marks missing, obsolete, or
unrefreshed snapshots; new explicit selections return
`model_execution_catalog_unknown` until discovery finishes. The saved model and
thinking level are preserved. Custom Runtime connections keep their own catalogs.

## Canonical command tree

Reusable workspace connections use `remi runtime profile list|get|create|update|delete`.
Create/update accepts `name`, `provider` (`codex` or `claude`), a structured `profile`,
and an optional write-only `api_key`. The structured profile accepts an optional
`models` allowlist containing its default `model`; omitting it keeps provider model
discovery authoritative. Updates replace configuration and allocate a
new revision; omitting `api_key` preserves an existing key. Use
`remi runtime group list|get|create|update|delete` to bind profiles to explicit
Runtime members. Writes require workspace administration, and group changes also
require permission to edit the affected Runtimes. Task and daemon credentials
cannot manage these resources. Examples and migration limits are in
[execution configuration](dev/execution-configuration.md).

The older `runtime codex-profile get|set` and `runtime claude-profile get|set`
commands remain available for retained per-Runtime connections. New configuration
uses central profiles; the legacy commands do not edit a group's central profile.

For either custom connection, `remi runtime model refresh <runtime>` asks its
daemon to discover the provider catalog. Poll `runtime model status <runtime>
<request-id>` for completion, then use `runtime model list <runtime>`. These
model commands are available to task credentials without exposing connection
secrets. Set a cloud agent's selection with `remi agent update <agent> --model <model-id>`;
the connection's configured model remains the default when no model is selected.

The canonical tree includes a focused top-level Attachment download command;
Issue and Comment keep their scoped attachment listing and management commands.

`remi task list` accepts `--limit` and `--offset`. The limit applies to the
tasks the caller is allowed to see, not to the scanned rows: `GET
/api/multiremi/tasks` walks candidates in chunks, applies the same per-task
visibility filter as before, and stops once the page is full. Omitting
`--limit` returns at most 100 tasks (the server cap is 500) and reports
`has_more` / `next_offset` for the next page. List entries omit `result`,
`prompt`, `pluginSnapshot` / `plugin_snapshot`, `executionFingerprint` /
`execution_fingerprint` and `usage`; `remi task get` and
`GET /api/multiremi/tasks/:id` still return the full task.

Chat Tasks can deliver files to their current conversation with
`remi chat attachment send --attachment report.html --attachment chart.png`.
`--content`, `--content-file`, and `--content-stdin` optionally add a caption.
The server resolves the destination from the Task credential; no Feishu chat ID
is needed. Each file must be non-empty, at most 20MB, and pass the server's file type allowlist.
Within one command, the caption precedes the files, which are delivered in input
order. A retry keeps later files waiting; a permanent failure marks the remaining
files failed with the reason. Raster images larger than 10MB use file cards;
smaller images use inline image messages. SVG files always use file cards.
The response includes attachment IDs and queued delivery IDs; queueing does not
mean Feishu has acknowledged delivery. This command requires a Chat Task credential.

Use `remi help <path>` or `remi <path> --help` for the registered positional and
option contract. All capability commands declare their authentication identities,
mutation class, and `table|json|jsonl` output contract in the Registry.

Password authentication uses `remi context auth password --file -` with JSON
containing `email` and `password` on standard input. It saves the returned session
in the selected CLI configuration and prints a user summary without credentials.
Deployment administrators can provision or reset an account with
`remi context auth password-account set --file -`; the body additionally accepts
`name` and `workspaceId` (default `local`). That operation requires the deployment
master token and grants the account owner membership in the selected workspace.
Both commands are unavailable to task identities; password values have no dedicated
command-line flag and should be supplied without putting them in shell history.
Both commands validate file/stdin JSON before resolving request context or making
network requests, so malformed input errors cannot quote password fragments.
Account provisioning sends only the API's `workspaceId` field; `--workspace`
overrides either workspace spelling in the input and selects the same request header.

`remi runtime workspace list|create|get|rename|archive` manages persistent execution
directories owned by a Runtime's daemon. This is distinct from the team tenant
managed by `remi workspace`. Use `--runtime-workspace <id>` on `chat create` or
`issue create|update` to select it. See the [runtime workspace contract](dev/runtime-workspaces.md)
for local context, directory lifetime, and the immutable execution binding.

`remi runtime delete <runtime> --yes` and `runtime archive-agents-and-delete`
block on uncleaned Issue workspaces. Add `--abandon-issue-workspaces` only after
reviewing the affected Issue list. For historical records with no Runtime,
`remi issue workspace abandon <issue> --yes` releases their task affinity and
retains local files. Records still attached to a Runtime must use deletion or
retirement instead. `remi issue workspace <issue>` remains the read command.

`remi runtime prepare [--provider claude|codex]` installs this release's fixed ACP
and Agent dependencies, verifying executables and ACP initialization without
switching a running daemon. Without `--provider` it prepares the configured or
detected providers that have an ACP bundle and skips the rest (such as
antigravity), succeeding with empty `runtimes` when none remain; an explicit
`--provider` other than claude or codex is rejected. This local command does not require server authentication.
Maintainers refresh dependencies before every release with
`bun run release:prepare --version <next>`; daemons do not poll the registry.
See [daemon runtime upgrades](daemon-runtime-upgrades.md) for the release and
installation checks.

`remi runtime skill scan <runtime> --root '~/.agents/skills'` discovers skills in
a directory on that Runtime's machine. Poll `runtime skill status <runtime>
<scan-request>` until it completes, then import a returned key with `runtime skill
import <runtime> --scan-request <scan-request> --key <skill-key>`. The scan binds
the import to the selected directory; `--name` and `--description` optionally
override library metadata. Poll `runtime skill import-status <runtime>
<import-request>` to obtain the imported skill. These operations require an online
Runtime owned by the caller. Imports copy content into the Remi skill library;
assign the imported skill to a cloud agent separately. Runtime imports preserve
text and binary supporting files. File JSON uses optional `encoding: "base64"`
for binary content; omitted encoding means UTF-8. Agents using binary files
require an updated daemon; older daemons receive an upgrade error when no
compatible task can be claimed, leaving those tasks available after the update. See the
[Runtime skill import contract](runtime-skills.md) for file limits and daemon
compatibility. JSON request input remains available through `--data` or `--file`;
`--json` selects JSON output.

### Repository checkout defaults

`remi repo checkout <repository-or-url>` without `--ref` prefers the workspace
repository's configured `default_branch`. Direct URLs use a best-effort lookup
in the repository directory; lookup failures do not prevent checkout. If the
configured branch cannot be resolved, checkout falls back to the existing remote
default selection (`origin/HEAD`, then `main`, then `master`). An explicit `--ref`
remains strict: an unknown branch or commit fails rather than falling back.

Issue worktrees and intake snapshots use the same preference. Repository records
are authoritative; stored project resource `default_branch_hint` values remain
read-time fallbacks, without rewriting resource rows. Existing issue worktrees
are preserved, not reset to a newly configured branch. Workspace API `base_ref`
retains its full ref; `base_commit` reports the common baseline with the existing
worktree HEAD, or null when no common ancestor can be resolved.

Chat management uses `remi chat pin|unpin|archive|restore <chat>`. Archiving stops
unfinished runs and makes the conversation read-only until restored. While a
Chat is running, `remi chat queue list|update|remove|clear|prioritize` manages its
queued follow-ups. `prioritize <chat> <task>` moves the selected message next and
stops the current run; `update <chat> <task> --content-file <path>` edits only a
message that has not started. See the [Chat contract](chat.md).

The Feishu ingestion domain exposes source administration through
`remi feishu source list|get|status|add|update` and task-safe processing through
`remi feishu messages list|resolve|notify|draft-reply|propose-issue`. Issue
proposals are non-blocking Inbox items; only humans can run
`remi feishu proposals approve|reject` or the administrative direct
`messages create-issue` command. Dedicated commands atomically create their
Inbox/Issue object and audited outcome, and generic `resolve` cannot forge those
outcomes. An empty source allowlist means zero ingestion; `source update
--clear-allowlist` restores that state.

Feishu bots default to Agent capabilities: anyone who can message the bot may
use its enabled capabilities without sender approval. `remi workspace feishu-bot
set <workspace> ... --sender-access-policy agent|allowlist` selects this policy;
omitting the option preserves the saved choice. Existing bot configurations
upgrade to `agent`. Agent and inherited task proposal policies still apply.

The optional Feishu bot sender allowlist uses `remi workspace feishu-bot sender
list <workspace>`, `allow <workspace> <sender>`, and `revoke <workspace> <sender>`.
The sender ID comes from `list`; accounts are discovered from incoming bot
requests and deduplicated within the current bot app. These human-only commands
manage permission to create Issues through bot Chats without linking senders to
Remi users or workspace members. This account allowlist is separate from the
Messaging Source conversation allowlist. See the [sender policy](feishu-message-ingestion.md#机器人发送者白名单)
for active Chat checks and legacy restricted sessions.

`sender list` also refreshes names from previously received bot messages; JSON
includes optional `name_en`, and table output includes `ENGLISH_NAME`. Profile
refresh preserves sender IDs and allowlist decisions.

The current main integration also exposes archived Issue recovery, Workspace
prompt/archive settings, and Repository Wiki administration through:

```text
remi issue restore
remi workspace prompt get|update
remi workspace issue-archive get|update
remi wiki repository list|get|create|update|delete|revisions|backlinks|build
remi knowledge submit|submissions|inspect|runs|run show|migrate-legacy
remi wiki publish
remi memory publish
remi platform operation cancel <operation> --yes
```

`remi wiki repository list <repo>` prints document metadata only, matching the
API list contract from [ADR 0002](adr/0002-repository-wiki-list-without-bodies.md).
Pass `--include-body --ids <a,b>` (at most 20 ids per request) to fetch bodies
for specific documents.

平台更新设置使用 `remi platform settings update --file <settings.json> --yes`，
文件可包含 `{"releaseFeedUrl":"https://example.com/platform-release.json"}`，
或 `{"releaseFeedUrl":null}` 恢复主机默认来源。执行
`remi platform operation create --file <operation.json> --yes`，文件包含
`{"kind":"check_updates"}`，会刷新版本和可更新性检查；结果通过
`remi platform status` 读取。更新、回滚和重启均要求更新器在线、预检通过，
并等待 Runtime 确认空闲。备份与恢复约束见[平台部署](../deploy/README.md)。

## Current user identity

`remi member get me`, `remi member update me`, and `remi member onboarding ...`
read or update the authenticated user's profile and onboarding state. The Web
console uses the same `/api/me` routes, so reloading a page preserves that
identity. The Web-to-CLI exchange at `POST /api/cli-token` keeps the same user ID
and workspace membership permissions. A signed identity whose user no longer
exists is rejected with `401`; deployment-master requests and unauthenticated
requests in open local mode retain the existing `local` identity.

## Workspace request context

Workspace-scoped collection and creation routes in both API families resolve
context before authorizing and accessing the same workspace. This includes
agents, skills, chats, runtimes, model catalogs, dashboards, issues, projects,
labels, autopilots, squads, pins, members, tokens, notifications, feedback,
plugins, daemon management, knowledge migration and onboarding bootstrap.
Supported explicit body/query workspace IDs generally come first, followed by
`X-Workspace-ID`, `X-Workspace-Slug`, the credential's workspace, and finally
`local` when no context exists. Existing field priorities remain unchanged:
compatibility context routes keep the ID header ahead of `workspace_id` query;
compatibility label creation accepts both body fields with snake_case first.
Unknown slugs return `404` when slug resolution is needed, without falling back
to `local`. Selecting a workspace does not grant membership or broaden a
task, daemon, share or workspace-scoped machine credential.

Agent list, ordinary creation, template creation and default-agent creation share
this resolution. Their explicit workspace IDs use body before query, with
`workspaceId` before `workspace_id` within each source. An explicit ID takes
priority over a conflicting or unknown slug; when slug resolution is needed, an
unknown slug returns `404` without falling back. Membership and credential-scope
checks still apply to the resolved workspace. Regression coverage is in
[`agent-workspace-context.test.ts`](../tests/unit/multiremi/agent-workspace-context.test.ts).

Resource operations authorize the resource's workspace. Runtime usage queries
use that same workspace even when a page sends a stale selector; an empty
runtime list cannot redirect the model catalog to `local`. Skill and label
details and mutations check resource access, and skill search requires workspace
access before returning summaries. Skills retain their explicit query mismatch
check, and attachment creation derives scope from the referenced resource when
the body omits a workspace. Multipart uploads reject references spanning
different workspaces before writing either attachment metadata or a file.

Inbox collection and bulk operations resolve the caller's membership only
inside the selected workspace. Human and task credentials cannot select another
member's inbox. Store queries and bulk updates also filter the inbox row's
workspace, so moving a membership does not expose or modify its former
workspace's notifications. Single-item read/archive operations authorize both the resource
workspace and recipient before writing; an explicit selector must match, and
repeated authorized operations remain valid for archived items.
Moving a workspace member requires administration of both source and destination;
the source workspace's administrator cannot grant membership in another workspace.

Daemon installation resolves and authorizes the selected workspace before
generating instructions or credentials. Registration without a body workspace
uses request context or the daemon credential's scope; daemon identity and
owner checks still apply. CLI daemon context filters runtimes by both daemon ID
and credential workspace. A login session does not become a daemon credential:
the install flow issues a daemon token, while legacy CLI-token promotion keeps
its existing workspace and purpose constraints.

The `*-workspace-context.test.ts` suites and
[`workspace-context-remaining.test.ts`](../tests/unit/multiremi/workspace-context-remaining.test.ts)
cover header-only requests, unknown slugs, explicit-selector priority, resource
scope and credential boundaries.

Registry resource commands choose `--workspace` first, then the JSON/file input's
`workspaceId` or `workspace_id`, environment, saved configuration, and `local`.
The request header and body use that same workspace; a default cannot overwrite
an explicit workspace from `--data` or `--file`.

An authenticated local-login session represents the real `local` user and checks
that user's memberships. Legacy workspace-scoped machine credentials retain
their scope. User-issued native tokens cannot impersonate another user or mint
login sessions; listing and revoking tokens also enforce the credential's scope.
CLI exchange preserves the source workspace and the verified local-login identity
without promoting legacy machine credentials into a human session.

Comment authors, resolution actors, reactions and upload ownership follow the
authenticated user or task agent. Caller-supplied actor fields remain available
for deployment-master and auth-disabled requests. Comment resolution accepts an
empty body even when the client sends `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Removed Chat Issue binding (MUL-301)

Chat Sessions are independent conversations. Creating an Issue from Chat no longer
binds the Chat or subscribes it to Issue activity. Feishu Issue topics retain their
Issue association in the Feishu binding table and continue receiving updates and
work-round replies. Legacy group associations without deterministic ownership
evidence require audited operator restoration before daemon traffic resumes;
see the [migration runbook](migrations/chat-issue-decoupling.md).

This is an intentional breaking capability removal, with no replacement command.
Unlike renamed command paths, it has no executable compatibility alias: retaining
one would restore the binding capability being removed. The five executable
commands removed are:

- `remi chat issue bind`
- `remi chat issue unbind`
- `remi chat issue updates get`
- `remi chat issue updates enable`
- `remi chat issue updates disable`

The `chat.issue` and `chat.issue.updates` grouping nodes are also removed.
Chat creation, messages, queues, pinning, archiving and restoration remain supported.
Chat session lists and the global pending-task list exclude Feishu Issue-topic
transport sessions, including topics created by the current user.

API changes:

- Chat session create/update no longer accept `issueId` or `issue_id`; sending
  either field returns HTTP 400.
- Chat session responses no longer include `issueId` (native API) or `issue_id`
  (compatibility API).
- Issue creation no longer returns `chat_issue_binding` or `chat_issue_binding_hint`.
- `GET` and `PUT /api/chat/sessions/:sessionId/issue-updates` are removed.
- CLI context no longer includes `current.chat.issue_id` or `current.bound_issue`.
- Internal daemon task wire removes `chat_bootstrap_transcript`; cold conversation
  history continues through the existing session projection.

## Autopilot run must not read as a query (MUL-468)

`remi autopilot run <autopilot>` shares its prefix with the read-only
`remi autopilot run list <autopilot>` and `remi autopilot run get <autopilot>
<run>`. In the parent help the `run` line borrowed the description of its first
child ("List autopilot runs including queued schedule targets"), so the trigger
command read as a query. On 2026-09-27 that misfire launched six unrequested
autopilot runs and published an unintended release; a second operator read it the
same way later that day.

Starting one run now has its own verb, matching the UI label:

- `remi autopilot run-now <autopilot>` — POST a run now, the same action as
  "立即运行 / Run now". `--data '{"trigger_id":"..."}'` selects the schedule
  trigger to start.
- `remi autopilot run <autopilot>` — rejects the invocation with a usage error and
  names the three correct commands. It sends no request at all, not even the
  autopilot name lookup.
- `remi autopilot run list|get` — unchanged read-only queries.

**This rename intentionally ships without a compatibility alias.** The repository
rule that deprecated command paths stay executable for one release assumes the old
path was a working spelling of the intent. Here the old spelling is exactly the
hazard: an alias would keep turning a read into a manual run on every Runtime that
has not upgraded yet, which is how this incident happened twice. The path is
therefore removed outright and replaced by the guard above, so an un-upgraded CLI
is the only way to still reach the old behavior.

The same audit found `remi task steer <task>` (write) sharing a prefix with
`remi task steer list <task>` (read). A bare steer with no `--content`,
`--content-file`, `--content-stdin`, or `--force-answer` would POST an empty
directive that the server rejects with 400; the CLI now fails locally before
sending anything. A Registry constraint test keeps any command that has
subcommands read-only, with `task.steer` the only registered exception.

## Deprecated aliases

`remi wiki lint` is deprecated since `0.2.58` with no CLI replacement. Wiki
review and organization now belong to Atlas lint mode; the legacy heuristic
scan remains hidden and executable for one release so in-flight task prompts
do not fail. It must be removed after that compatibility window.

All aliases below are deprecated since `0.3.0`. They remain executable for at
least one complete release cycle. Removal requires all supported platform and
daemon versions to advertise the canonical capability, prompt and skill audits
to remain clean, and a separately approved release change. This branch does not
remove any alias.

Nested Issue aliases and the local lifecycle aliases intentionally keep their
legacy dispatchers for byte-compatible arguments, stdout/stderr, and exit codes.
They are still present in Registry inventory and the capability manifest, so
they cannot become undocumented bypasses.

## IM platform management

The Web sidebar groups IM capabilities under **IM platforms → Feishu**. This
navigation change reuses the existing APIs and registered commands; it does not
introduce another CLI command family or change credential ownership.

| Web capability | Canonical CLI commands |
| --- | --- |
| Concierge configuration and status | `remi workspace feishu-bot get\|set\|status\|candidates\|test\|deploy\|stop` |
| Bot registration and per-Agent installations | `remi workspace feishu-bot register\|register-status\|register-cancel`, `remi lark install begin\|status`, `remi lark installation list\|delete` |
| Menu editing and publication | `remi workspace bot-menu get\|update\|publish\|publish-status` |
| Sender access | `remi workspace feishu-bot set`, `remi workspace feishu-bot sender list\|allow\|revoke` |
| Agent routes and Issue topics | `remi feishu route list\|set\|unset`, `remi workspace issue-topics get\|set` |
| Message connections and authorization | `remi messaging connection list\|get\|add\|update\|check\|delete`, `remi messaging connection authorization start\|get` |
| Sources and conversation selection | `remi messaging source list\|get\|add\|update\|status\|delete\|available-conversations` |
| History and processing | `remi messaging conversation list`, `remi messaging message list\|get\|resolve\|notify\|draft-reply\|propose-issue\|create-issue` |

Use each command's generated `--help` for positional workspace/record references
and required options. The Web uses Feishu compatibility endpoints where their
legacy ID contract is required; new automation should use `messaging` for the
generic connection/source/message model. The bot's app credentials and a
message-ingestion connection's authorization remain separate.

## Prompt and documentation migration

The server-injected agent prompt now uses only canonical commands in
`packages/daemon/src/agent-runtime/prompts/ephemeral.ts`:

- `remi comment list|add`
- `remi session result publish`
- `remi session log get <session> <seq|entry-id>` reads one complete entry. `remi session log get <session> --from X --to Y` reads the complete unread range `X < seq ≤ Y`, automatically follows pages and rejoins long bodies; task credentials omit the requesting agent's own history. These use the existing log-entry endpoint. `remi session event list` forwards `--since-seq` and `--to-seq` to the server.
- `remi memory search|get|create|update`

The matching durable command examples use canonical commands in
`docs/project-wiki-memory-spec.md`, `docs/issue-key-results.md`, and the frontend
Session-result convention comment. The repository-maintained
[Remi skill](../.agents/skills/remi/SKILL.md) provides CLI workflows with
task-specific references; keep its examples aligned with this command contract.
Legacy handler usage strings remain unchanged because they document commands
that are deliberately supported during the compatibility period.
