/**
 * The page ⇄ Worker messages (MUL-403 C7 §2, §7).
 *
 * The split follows the plan's constraint literally: "流数据的处理放在 worker 里，
 * 不依赖页面定时器，因为后台标签页的定时器会被节流". So the page owns the socket
 * (the token lives in `localStorage`, which a worker cannot read) and forwards the
 * frames it receives unchanged; deciding what they mean — inserting, patching,
 * coverage, the gap to backfill — happens inside the Worker, on the storage's
 * thread, with no timer of its own.
 *
 * Nothing here is a second protocol: the bodies are the same six steps, sent as
 * messages instead of calls.
