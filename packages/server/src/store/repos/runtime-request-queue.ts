// The queue protocol shared by every daemon async-request family (model list, directory scan,
// runtime update, local-skill list, local-skill import, runtime command).
//
// All six families run the same lifecycle — a row is inserted `pending`, claimed into `running`,
// timed out on either deadline, then closed by a report — and previously existed as five verbatim
// copies of `get`/`claim`/`expire` in runtimes-repo.ts. The copies differed only in table name,
// id prefix, the two deadlines and the human-readable timeout copy, so those five knobs are now a
// `RuntimeRequestSpec` and the bodies live here once. `create` and `report` stay with their family
// because their column lists and completed-branch payloads genuinely differ.

   * concurrently their sub-selects can both pick the same id; the loser then blocks on the row

   * version. Without the status re-check the loser's WHERE (`id = ?`) would still match and it
   * would return the row the winner already took — the same request handed to two daemons. With
   * it, the loser sees `status = 'running'`, matches nothing and returns null, and the caller
   * simply waits for the next heartbeat. SQLite serializes writers, so this is a no-op there.
   *
   * `sweep` is for callers that have already proved the deadline sweep would write nothing
   * (the heartbeat's merged probe does this); it skips the extra UPDATE, never a claim.
