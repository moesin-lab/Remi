// MUL-473 (S9-2, PR1, QA rework): equivalence guards for `resolveAssigneeRef`.
//
// PR1 first added `usr_ -> member` to `inferAssigneeTypeFromRef`, which *locked*
// the untyped search to the member table. A legal Agent named `usr_alias` — QA's
// counterexample — had resolved as that Agent before, and started throwing
// `Member not found`. This file pins the behaviour to the pre-PR implementation
// instead of to a restatement of the new rules.
//
// Read the search order for what it is: Agent, Member, Squad is only the order in
// which the three kinds are *queried*. Every kind that matches contributes a
// candidate, and ambiguity is decided once, over the collected set — a reference
// that matches two kinds is refused, it is not awarded to whichever kind was
// queried first. In particular, a member `user_id` that is also an Agent name is
// `Ambiguous assignee reference`, not "the Agent wins".
//
//   1. `tests/fixtures/multiremi/capture-assignee-ref-golden.ts` was run on the
//      pre-PR implementation `593ff2ba` (the parent of this branch), with this
//      branch's copy of that script and `assignee-ref-fixture.ts` placed in that
//      checkout, and its output is checked in as `assignee-ref-golden.json`. In
//      a `593ff2ba` worktree that already has those two files:
//
//        bun run tests/fixtures/multiremi/capture-assignee-ref-golden.ts \
//          --baseline --out tests/fixtures/multiremi/assignee-ref-golden.json
//
//      That command reproduces the checked-in file byte for byte — `--baseline`
//      writes the `pre-MUL-473 implementation (593ff2ba)` source label the file
//      carries, so no post-processing is needed. Expected values below are read
//      from it, never hand-written.
//   2. The store-level answer (`{assigneeType, assigneeId}` or the exact error
//      message) and the HTTP-level answer (`GET /api/issues?assignee_id=…`'s
//      status, `total` and id list) are both compared, because the route's total
//      is what a regression here actually breaks.
//   3. The fixture pins id generation, because two of the collisions are with
//      generated member `user_id`s.
