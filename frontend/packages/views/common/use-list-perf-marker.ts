/**
 * List-page readiness marker (MUL-472 item 5).
 *
 * MUL-383's probe resolves `--selectors auto` from the document: it measures
 * through the contract table only when a `[data-perf-scroll]` element exists
 * (`frontend/scripts/perf/lib/selectors.ts`, `jump-recorder.ts`). The detail and
 * chat routes carry one; the list pages had none, so every list round in both
 * 09-28 baselines (32/32 rows) fell back to the legacy table and a fast list
 * round could not be told apart from a skeleton-free render of rows nobody had
 * confirmed were new.
 *
 * The marker is the same attribute the probe already looks for, on the page's
 * own list container, and it is published **only after this page's own list
 * request resolved**. Its presence therefore means "the rows on screen are the
 * answer to a request this page issued", which is exactly what the probe needs
 * to certify a list round. Nothing else changes: no styles, no layout, no
 * behaviour, and the `data-perf-state` / `data-perf-fresh` pair stays owned by
 * `useAnchoredReveal` (MUL-443) — this marker never writes them.
