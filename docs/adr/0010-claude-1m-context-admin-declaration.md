# ADR 0010: Claude 1M context is an administrator declaration per gateway model

## Status

Accepted on 2026-09-28 (MUL-479). Implemented with the MUL-479 PR.

## Context

`packages/acp/src/adapters/claude-code/model-context.ts` carried a hand-written
list of Claude model IDs that "support 1M" and appended `[1m]` to the session
startup model for those IDs. The list drifted as soon as it was written:

- `claude-opus-5-5` was not on it, so every Opus 5.5 Agent ran with a 200K
  window and compacted at ~167K (Remi-CC: 29 compactions, 70–90 s each).
- `claude-opus-5` was on it, but Claude Code 2.1.283 no longer offers an
  Opus 5 row; the bridge's version guard refuses the 5 → 5.5 fuzzy match.
- `claude-fable-5-1[1m]` was on it. Selecting a synthesized startup row makes
  the CLI confirm the model over the network at `setModel` time; when that
  round-trip fails the bridge answers JSON-RPC `-32603`. This reproduces a path
  consistent with Senior大哥's four failures between 9/26 and 9/28; their
  historical timing alone does not prove each failure's cause.

The user decided (9/28): no automatic probing of any kind. The platform keeps
no model list. An administrator turns 1M on or off per gateway model in
Settings → Model gateway, and the platform only executes that setting.

Live probe on 2026-09-28 against bridge `claude-agent-acp` 0.81.2 / Claude
Code 2.1.283 (sessions created, no prompt sent):

| Startup `--model` | Session env (`_meta.claudeCode.options.env`) | `set_config_option` value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-5-5` | none | `claude-opus-5-5[1m]` | selects menu row `opus[1m]`, 12 ms, effort selector intact |
| `claude-opus-5` | `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION=claude-opus-5[1m]` | `claude-opus-5[1m]` | custom row "Opus 5 (1M context)" appears and is selected, 7 ms, effort intact |
| `claude-opus-5-5` | `…=claude-opus-5-5[1m]` | `claude-opus-5-5[1m]` | duplicate custom row next to `opus[1m]`; the custom (pinned) row is selected, effort intact |
| `claude-fable-5-1` | none | `claude-fable-5-1[1m]` | fuzzy-matched to the 200K row `claude-fable-5-1`, 2.5 s (network confirm) |
| `claude-fable-5-1` | `…=claude-fable-5-1[1m]` | `claude-fable-5-1[1m]` | CLI normalizes the row to value `claude-fable-5-1`, description `Custom model (claude-fable-5-1[1m])`; selected, 1.9 s |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `…=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001[1m]` | same | accepted ("Haiku 4.5 (1M context)"); effort selector disappears. The CLI does not validate 1M support |
| `claude-opus-5[1m]` | none | `claude-opus-5[1m]` | CLI synthesizes a picker row for the startup model; selected after a 2.0 s network confirm |
| `claude-nonexistent-9[1m]` | none | same | session/new succeeds (no startup rejection); selection fails `-32603 Internal error` after 1.5 s |
| `claude-nonexistent-9` | `…=claude-nonexistent-9[1m]` | same | accepted in 6 ms with no validation at all |

Two premises in the original discussion are therefore false: Claude Code does
not reject an unknown startup model, and the custom-option row is not
validated against the gateway. Each Remi pool entry spawns its own bridge
process, and the bridge merges `_meta.claudeCode.options.env` into the CLI
subprocess environment, so "process-level env" is not a sharing problem here.

## Decision

1. **Storage: its own table.** `multiremi_gateway_model_context`
   (`workspace_id`, `engine`, `model_id`, `context_window` = `'1m'`,
   `updated_by`, `updated_at`; primary key workspace × engine × model). A row
   present means 1M on; clearing deletes the row. It is separate from the
   discovery snapshot (rewritten on every probe) and from
   `multiremi_gateway_model_reasoning`, whose invariant is "levels are never
   empty" and which cannot host a model that only needs a context flag.
2. **Delivery: the daemon relay wire.** `relay.claude.one_million_models`
   (sorted model IDs) rides on register, every 10 s heartbeat ack and the
   workspace-repos refresh. It is not part of the execution fingerprint: a
   running task keeps its process; the next task reads the current setting.
   Runtime connection profiles replace `relay.claude` wholesale and are out
   of scope.
3. **Selection: plain startup model, custom option row, one attempt.** The
   session `_meta` startup model stays the Agent's model. When the model is
   declared, the session env carries `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION=<model>[1m]`
   (documented Claude Code feature, per session via
   `_meta.claudeCode.options.env`) and the provider sends
   `session/set_config_option(model, "<model>[1m]")` once per created,
   resumed or loaded session. Success means the selected value ends in
   `[1m]`, or the selected row's description contains the injected ID (the
   Fable normalization above). Any error, or a non-1M selection, logs one
   `[acp_model_context_fallback]` warning, re-selects the plain model and
   reads back the actual selection. If the plain row cannot be selected, it
   keeps the bridge's actual model and reports that value without claiming a
   standard window; the attempt is cached separately from the actual model.
   The task continues, matching ordinary out-of-menu model behavior.
   Warm load receives the same startup metadata and session env as new/resume.
   A dead bridge process rethrows. The custom option value is part
   of the pool entry's staleness key, so a model change recreates the process.
4. **Explicit `[1m]` in the Agent model stays strict** (pass through, fail if
   the bridge does not land on a 1M lane). The former automatic-selection
   environment opt-out is removed: the declaration is the only switch.
5. **No gateway validation.** Claude Code accepts any custom row. The settings
   page states this next to the switch; a model that does not support 1M fails
   on its first prompt with the gateway's error, and the administrator turns
   the switch off.
6. **Pin bridge state to the requested model on new and restored sessions.** After merging the
   provider environment, set bridge-process `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to the original
   requested model for every Claude session with a model. The bridge reads this value
   before settings and archived hints when constructing model/effort state;
   `_meta` alone does not update that state. Fable's redundant `set_model`
   otherwise sends a one-token API validation with an approximately five-second
   deadline and can fail as `-32603`. Correct bridge state skips that Remi RPC
   without weakening selection checks. Store `startupModel` in the pool entry
   and recreate a pinned process when its requested model changes, including
   processes created for resume. Since `98c31674`, the daemon seeds the host's
   `settings.model` into isolated homes; without env it overrides the archive
   on restore and recreates the ordinary Fable confirmation failure path.
   The bridge reasserts the env model internally on resume/load, but logs a
   failed reassertion and falls back to the archived model without throwing.
   Runtime profile env is preserved because its model equals the task's
   requested model. Warm load retains the process env and the P1 session meta.

## Rejected

- **Try `[1m]` first, fall back on rejection (the original MUL-479 plan).**
  User decision. Also technically weak: the only rejection signal is a
  network confirm that fails intermittently, which is the -32603 source.
- **Startup `--model <model>[1m]` with the synthesized row.** Undocumented CLI
  behaviour; costs a ~2 s network confirm per session; and for an off-menu
  model there is no plain row to fall back to, because only the startup value
  is synthesized.
- **`availableModels` via `_meta.claudeCode.options.settings`.** The bridge's
  allowlist filter reads only file-based settings from the session cwd, so a
  per-session settings object never reaches the picker.
- **Extend the reasoning-levels table with a column.** Breaks its "levels are
  non-empty or the row does not exist" invariant (MUL-338).
- **Prefer the native alias row (`opus[1m]`) when the model is on the menu.**
  Cannot be known before the process is spawned, and the alias floats to the
  next Opus on a Claude Code upgrade. The pinned custom row is the truthful
  reading of an Agent configured with `claude-opus-5-5`.
- **Skip selection by trusting startup metadata alone.** Leaves the bridge's
  model, effort and initial context state inconsistent. Process-env pinning
  gives the bridge itself the correct state with the same RPC count.
- **Retry Fable confirmation or change the CLI deadline.** Retrying adds latency
  without removing the deadline; changing native CLI/SDK confirmation requires
  an upstream patch or undocumented control fields. The redundant new-session
  call can instead be removed in this PR.
- **Stop seeding `settings.model` into isolated homes.** Env already has higher
  priority. Changing home seeding adds no benefit here and affects every Claude
  task, including Agents without a configured model.
- **Swallow ordinary-model setter errors in Remi.** Would accept a genuinely
  unavailable requested model. Bridge restore containment is narrower and keeps
  the existing provider error semantics.

## Consequences

- After merge standard model IDs do not opt into 1M until an administrator
  declares a model. Explicit `[1m]` selections are unchanged. Ordinary Opus
  5.5 Agents stay at 200K until `claude-opus-5-5` is switched on.
- The picker shows a duplicate row for on-menu models (cosmetic).
- Prompts above 200K input are billed at the long-context rate; the usage
  pricing table does not model the surcharge (frontend `resolvePricing`).
- Bridge or CLI upgrades can change custom-row behaviour; the acceptance run
  (Opus 5.5 at >200K without compaction) must be repeated after
  `release:prepare` bumps `packages/acp/src/runtime-versions.json`.
- Every Fable resume/load adds approximately 1-5 seconds for the bridge's
  internal reassertion; failure is logged and falls back to the archive.
  The remaining ordinary-model failure path requires both an archived model
  different from the request and a failed reassertion. Remi's necessary setter
  can still fail at its deadline; that error remains fatal.
  Declared 1M selection is still applied after restore when needed.
- New-session and cold-resume Fable gates each require 20/20 exact current-model acknowledgments with
  zero Remi model RPCs and zero failures, plus env/stale unit mutations.
  The 24-hour post-release observation remains confirmation, not a merge gate.
  Internal bridge restore errors are counted, not gate failures, when the
  archived Fable model is reported. Keep `settings.model=opus[1m]` in restore
  checks. Revert the isolated R1 commit to roll back resume pinning; the
  new-session P2 pin, administrator declaration and P1 load fix remain independent.
