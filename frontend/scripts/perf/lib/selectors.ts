/**
 * Every selector the MUL-383 page-speed probe uses, in one place.
 *
 * Two tables, same elements:
 *  - `contract` — the `data-perf-*` attributes MUL-384 adds. Preferred.
 *  - `legacy`   — the pre-MUL-384 DOM. Production runs the probe before S2's
 *                 reveal hook ships, so the first baselines measure this table.
 *
 * `--selectors auto` decides per round: a page carrying `[data-perf-scroll]`
 * uses contract, otherwise legacy. A contract round also samples the legacy table
 * on the same DOM, so `selectorEquivalence` can prove the tables agree before any
 * contract-mode number is trusted.
 *
 * Deleting the legacy table needs two things: S2 merged, and at least one
 * contract-mode baseline published. See `docs/dev/performance.md`.
