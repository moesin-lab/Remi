/**
 * Per-request API performance metrics (MUL-367).
 *
 * WHY: the API previously had no per-request timing at all, so "the web app is
 * slow" could only be investigated with a temporary nginx timing log and manual
 * PostgreSQL sampling. Everything here answers one question per request — how
 * much wall time it took, how much of that was spent blocked on the synchronous
 * Postgres bridge, and how many bytes crossed that bridge — and ships the answer
 * three ways: a `Server-Timing` response header for DevTools, one stdout line
 * per slow request, and one stdout line per minute aggregating the window.
 *
 * COST MODEL (this runs on every request, so the rules are structural):
 *   - `recordDbQuery` / `recordDbParse` are O(1) property increments behind one
 *     boolean. No allocation, no timers, no IO.
 *   - Per-request values ride on one AsyncLocalStorage store per request. The PG
 *     bridge is synchronous, so whatever is running during `Atomics.wait` is by
 *     construction the request that issued the query.
 *   - The window buffer is a fixed-capacity set of typed arrays with route and
 *     method strings interned to integer ids; it never grows per request.
 *   - The only periodic work is the summary timer plus its event-loop-lag probe.
 *     Both are `unref()`ed and torn down by `server.stop()`.
 *   - Log events are plain `console.log(JSON.stringify(...))` lines. Using
 *     `createLogger` was checked and rejected: only INFO reaches stdout (WARN and
 *     ERROR go to stderr), the human-readable tag means one entry is not one JSON
 *     object, and once `initLogPersistence()` has run every entry becomes an
 *     `appendFileSync` — synchronous disk IO on the request path.
 *
 * PRIVACY: recorded routes are Hono route PATTERNS (`/api/issues/:id`), never
 * the request path or query. The real path of `/api/shares/:token` contains a
 * credential, which is precisely why the pattern is the only safe thing to emit.
 * No header, body, user, or token value is recorded anywhere in this module.

/**
 * Per-request accumulator. One instance per request, never shared.
 *
 * `method`/`route` are the Hono route PATTERN and verb, resolved once when the
 * request enters the middleware. The PG bridge reads them through
 * `currentDbReplyOrigin()` so a bridge-level log (`api_large_db_reply`,
 * `api_db_reply_rejected`) can name the route without ever touching the real
 * path — the same privacy rule `api_slow_request` follows.
