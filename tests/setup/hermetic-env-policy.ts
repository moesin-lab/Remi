 * `MULTIREMI_PG_REPLY_MAX_BYTES` is here on purpose (MUL-398 C-1): production

 * to preserve existing HTTP behavior; tests explicitly preload ENFORCE=1 so an

 * The threshold value is
 * duplicated from the source constant rather than imported, so this preload stays
 * dependency-free; `tests/arch/hermetic-test-env.test.ts` asserts the two agree.
 *
 * `MULTIREMI_TEST_LOCK_ORDER_SENTINEL` is set here rather than left to the caller
 * because it must be ON for the whole suite by default; a developer can still
 * turn it off explicitly with `MULTIREMI_TEST_LOCK_ORDER_SENTINEL=0`, since
 * `MULTIREMI_TEST_*` names survive the scrub.
