/**
 * Daemon-side storage for one task's normalized trace (MUL-401 §5).
 *
 * A-0 ships the interface and an in-memory implementation that tests and the
 * A-6 wiring use. MUL-402's `worker/trace-file-store.ts` implements the same
 * interface on disk; the interface is the contract between them, so it must not
 * grow a file-only concept (paths, rotations, fsync policy) and must not leak the
 * in-memory one (object identity, shared arrays).
 *
 * Two responsibilities live here rather than at the call sites, because this is
 * the only durable write point in the trace path (MUL-402 rulings 2 and 6b):
 *
 *   - **Sequencing.** `append` assigns the per-task `seq`. Dense, from 1, never
 *     rewritten; a retry that appends the same logical event gets a new sequence,
 *     so deduplication above this layer keys on the event, not the sequence.
 *   - **Sanitizing.** `append` applies the byte caps and structured-field guards
 *     from `@shared/trace-sanitize.js`. The frame and the file therefore carry
 *     identical, already-bounded events, and nothing downstream needs its own cap.
 *
 * `TraceEvent.ts` is assigned here too: the store is what knows the write time.
