/**
 * Daemon-level session registry for protocol v2 (MUL-417).
 *
 * v1 keyed its registry by runtime (`Map<runtimeId, Set<socket>>`) because each
 * socket served exactly one runtime. v2 has one socket per daemon process, so the
 * primary key is the daemon and a secondary index answers the one question the
 * rest of the server still asks per runtime: "which connection can I send
 * `trace.read` for this runtime to?".
 *
 * Two facts about replacement, both from the protocol spec (§1.1):
 *
 *   - A newer connection for the same daemon wins, and the older one is closed
 *     with 4001. 4001 is `server_closing`, which the daemon retries with backoff,
 *     so a replacement looks like an ordinary reconnect to the losing side and
 *     never looks like an authority failure.
 *   - A runtime may only be owned by one connection. If a second daemon claims a
 *     runtime the first one already serves, the FIRST keeps it and the newcomer
 *     reports that runtime as unavailable (`runtime_gone` on its next heartbeat).
 *     Evicting the first would take every other runtime on that machine down with
 *     it, and one stale id is not worth that; the alternative of letting both
 *     drive it is exactly what the single-socket design exists to stop.
 *
 * The registry holds sessions, never sockets: closing is the session's business,
 * which keeps this file testable with fakes and keeps close codes out of the
 * registry's vocabulary.
