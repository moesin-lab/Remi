   * Upsert archive pointers for one ingest, under the ruling's swap rule.

   * whichever transaction commits second re-evaluates the condition against the
   * row the first one left behind. The allowed transitions are exactly the
   * ruling's:
   *
   * - the pointer is `daemon`, `backfilling` or `none` (it holds no archive
   *   bytes, so any archive is strictly better);
   * - the pointer is an `archive` of the same source and the incoming member
   *   reaches at least as far (`head >= head_seq`), so a partial or stale archive
   *   never moves a reader backwards;
   * - the pointer is a `trace_backfill` archive and the incoming member is a
   *   daemon's, whatever the heads: the two sources number seq differently (the
   *   old task_messages seq is sparse and restarts at 1 on every daemon run), so
   *   seq is never compared across sources and the daemon's own trace wins.
   *
   * A `trace_backfill` member therefore never replaces a daemon archive. `lost`
   * is deliberately absent: a retired daemon's trace is unrecoverable by
   * definition and an arriving archive must not resurrect a pointer to it.
   * A rejected update still leaves the archive `ready`; only the pointer stays,
   * and the caller gets the reason for every member it did not write.
   *
   * Must be called inside the caller's transaction: the archive goes `ready`
   * only together with its pointers.
