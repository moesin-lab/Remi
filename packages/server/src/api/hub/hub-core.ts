/**
 * The Live Hub itself (MUL-403 §1, C1 / MUL-436).
 *
 * One hub per API process fans out two ordered streams whose home is decided per
 * kind (ADR 0007 decision 1):
 *
 *   - `log:<session_id>` — MUL-402's conversation log. The database owns the
 *     sequence; a peer process sends only a head pointer, and a process that holds
 *     the stream reads `(local_head, head]` through an injected reader.
 *   - `trace:<task_id>` — MUL-401's daemon trace. It has exactly one home, the
 *     runtime process the daemon is connected to, so it never crosses a process.
 *
 * The hub assigns no sequence: a frame carries the sequence its owner gave it,
 * `<= head` is a replay (dropped and counted), and `!= head + 1` is a hole that
 * waits {@link HUB_HOLE_WAIT_MS} before the reader fills it.
 *
 * ## Why the fan-out is shaped this way
 *
 * An API process serves HTTP and fan-out on one event loop, so an append must
 * never wait for a subscriber:
 *
 *   - `append` / `onEntry` enqueue, mark the stream dirty and return.
 *   - A `setImmediate`-merged flush does the fan-out. One tick hands each
 *     subscriber **one batch frame**, capped at {@link HUB_BATCH_MAX_BYTES}; a
 *     single frame larger than the cap travels alone, because a subscriber cannot
 *     reassemble half a frame.
 *   - A subscriber whose sink reports more than {@link HUB_LAGGING_THRESHOLD_BYTES}
 *     buffered is paused until its transport calls `notifyDrain()`.
 *   - Frames are serialized once, on the way into the ring, and every subscriber
 *     receives that same frame object.
 *
 * ## What a subscriber is told when the ring cannot serve it
 *
 * Falling behind is not an error. The ring is a window, so a subscriber whose
 * cursor left it is told the missing range and reads that range from the route
 * that owns it (the browser from MUL-402's log windows, A-6 from the daemon's
 * `trace.fetch`). The hub never reads for a subscriber. The reads it performs
 * repair its own ring: cold-stream warm-up, peer head fill, continuity fill.
