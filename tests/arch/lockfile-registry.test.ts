/**
 * bun.lock must stay registry-neutral.
 *
 * bun records a tarball URL in a lock entry only when the package came from
 * somewhere other than registry.npmjs.org; for the default registry the field
 * is the empty string. A developer installing through an internal mirror
 * (`registry=` in ~/.npmrc or ~/.bunfig.toml) gets absolute mirror URLs for
 * every package bun re-resolves, which leaks an internal hostname into the
 * repository and breaks CI — release workflows install with
 * `--registry https://registry.npmjs.org --frozen-lockfile`, and neither flag
 * saves them: the frozen install accepts a mirror URL (the lockfile still
 * matches package.json) and bun downloads from the URL recorded in the lock
 * rather than from `--registry`, so the runner dies fetching a host it cannot
 * reach. This test is the only gate that catches it first.
 *
 * `bun run lock:clean` blanks those URLs back to the default-registry form.
