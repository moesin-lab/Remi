/**
 * Standalone read-only page-speed probe (MUL-383 S1 / plan §2).
 *
 * Measures how long the Issue detail, deep-link, chat and list pages take to
 * settle into their final position, how far they jump on the way there, and what
 * the first screen costs in API requests. Scenarios are `detail-short`,
 * `detail-long`, `detail-running` and `deeplink`, each in a cold-start and an
 * in-app-navigation variant, plus the eleven MUL-367 pages in both variants.
 *
 * Read-only guarantee: every non-GET/HEAD `/api/**` request is aborted inside
 * `page.route()` and reported under `blockedWrites`, so this can run against
 * production. `verifyWriteGuard` proves the guard itself works first.
 *
 * Credentials: the token comes from `MULTIREMI_QA_WEB_TOKEN` only. It is written
 * into the target origin's `localStorage` and never printed, logged, stored in
 * an output file or passed through argv.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   MULTIREMI_QA_WEB_TOKEN=... bun run frontend/scripts/perf/page-speed.ts \
 *     --base-url http://n37-117-209.byted.org --window peak --rounds 5 \
 *     --name MUL-383-baseline-peak-<date>
 *
 * Compare against an earlier schema-2 baseline (pairing is by key + mode):
 *   ... --compare reports/performance/MUL-383-baseline-offpeak-<date>.json
 *
 * Rule definitions and the selector tables: `docs/dev/performance.md`.
