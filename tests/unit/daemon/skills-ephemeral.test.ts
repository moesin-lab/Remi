/**
 * Per-task skill materialization.
 *
 * The skill root is runtime-specific: claude reads `.claude/skills`, while
 * codex-acp only ever registers `<root>/.agents/skills`
 * (refreshSkills → skills/extraRoots/set, codex-acp dist/index.js:26718-26731)
 * and never looks at `.claude/skills` — writing there for a codex task means
 * the agent silently runs with no skills at all.
