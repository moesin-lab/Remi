/**
 * The tab-to-tab channel (MUL-403 C7 §3).
 *
 * One leader tab owns the Worker, the database and the subscription; every other
 * tab asks it for what it needs over a `BroadcastChannel`. Two message kinds are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * - `replica:open` / `replica:close` — a tab announces a session it is showing,
 *   and the leader refcounts them so it subscribes exactly the sessions that at
 *   least one tab is watching (the acceptance criterion "只有 1 页在订阅");
 * - `replica:appended` / `replica:cleared` — the leader pushes out what changed,
 *   so a reader tab re-reads its window instead of polling.
 *
 * The channel carries no rows. A reader that learns "seqs 40..60 landed" reads
 * them from the leader with `replica:query`, which keeps the one-write-path
 * invariant: only the leader's Worker ever touches SQLite.
