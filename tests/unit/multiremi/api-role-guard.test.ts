/**
 * MUL-461 — `MULTIREMI_API_ROLE` and the role guard.
 *
 * The Issue fixes four things to prove:
 *   ① with the env var unset the process is main (the route snapshot in
 *      `tests/unit/multiremi/api-route-snapshot.test.ts` covers the byte-identical
 *      part; here the guard itself must be absent from the middleware chain);
 *   ② over the FULL golden route inventory: `ui` refuses every `/api/daemon/*`
 *      and nothing else, `runtime` is the mirror image, `all` refuses nothing;
 *   ③ WebSocket upgrades are refused with 421 rather than 426 — an upgrade never
 *      reaches Hono, so it is answered in `startMultiremiServer.fetch`, which is
 *      exactly the branch a middleware-only test would miss;
 *   ④ `role` reaches both metrics events and the health payloads.
 *
 * The matrix drives the same inventory the API snapshot does
 * (`scripts/api-routes.golden.json`, 759 patterns) instead of a hand-picked list,
 * so a route added later under either prefix is covered without editing this file.
