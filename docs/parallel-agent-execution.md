# Leader serialization and parallel Agent execution

## Scheduling

- A continuous Agent context is serialized by Issue Session and Agent. Leader
  turns and delegation-return turns use this continuous context.
- Each independent delegation has its own execution scope, derived from the
  existing delegation ID. Different delegations can run together, including
  multiple delegations to the same Agent. Retries keep their delegation scope.
- Issue-free one-shot tasks (including Wiki builds) are independent. Private
  Chat turns remain serialized. Existing Agent and Runtime capacity limits,
  project device routing, permissions and workspace affinity still apply.
- Tasks bound to the same [Runtime workspace](dev/runtime-workspaces.md) remain
  serialized across Agents and Sessions. Explicit Chat project selections keep
  their device routing even though Chat tasks do not hold an Issue workspace.
- A child result can immediately queue a Leader turn; other children do not
  delay it. Unclaimed returns coalesce, but a frozen prompt gets a later turn.
- Scheduled Wiki targets fill available Agent slots. Builds for the same
  publication target still deduplicate; different targets can progress together.

## Shared code, private execution state

Repository checkouts remain under the existing `issues/<issue-key>` root and
`agent/<issue-key>` branch. This change does not introduce per-task worktrees,
branches, automatic merges, or a single-writer restriction. Concurrent code
edits can conflict; Agents must coordinate edits and preserve peers' changes.

Task configuration, skills, Wiki working copies and provider caches use a
private execution directory under `.runtime/<session>/<agent>/.../work`.
Delegations add `delegations/<delegation-id>` to the provider generation path.
Prompts report absolute repository and session-history paths; the platform
continues to report the shared code workspace as the Issue workspace.

Executions hold shared lifecycle locks. Final archive, cleanup and workspace
migration still require exclusive ownership. Only repository preparation is
serialized briefly; the lock is not held exclusively while the model runs.

The activity card counts task states separately (running, starting, queued,
waiting for confirmation, waiting for a directory), including multiple tasks
using the same Agent. Queued tasks are not counted as running.

## Deployment requirements

1. Pause new claims and drain active tasks before upgrading the control plane.
2. Apply the normal database migration. It extends provider checkpoint keys
   with execution scope. Existing checkpoints and queued native-session pins
   cold-bootstrap once; canonical Session events, comments, code and history
   files are retained. The migration is idempotent.
3. Upgrade the Daemons before resuming claims. New Daemons register
   `parallel_agent_execution: 1`. Versioned old Daemons are intentionally
   ineligible for Issue tasks because their shared configuration is unsafe for
   parallel execution. Updating only the server is insufficient.
4. Check Agent and Runtime capacity using the existing settings or CLI. A
   Runtime limited to one task remains serial. This PR changes no live limits.

No new user API or CLI command is required: delegation, task inspection and
Agent/Runtime capacity use existing commands. `execution_scope` and the daemon
capability flag are internal execution protocol fields.
