# Provider Session Archive Retry Budget

Provider Session Archive uploads use a server-enforced retry budget. The daemon checks the
current archive before packing session files, while the server remains the
authoritative gate for every upload claim.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Valid range | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_RETRY_BASE_MS` | `60000` | 1 second to 1 hour | Initial automatic retry delay |
| `MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_RETRY_MAX_MS` | `3600000` | Base delay to 24 hours | Hard cap for automatic retry delay |
| `MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `6` | 1 to 100 | Maximum automatic upload attempts |
| `MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_UPLOAD_STALL_MS` | `900000` | 1 minute to 24 hours | Age after which an `uploading` attempt is stalled |

Invalid values fall back to their defaults. Restart the API service after
changing these process environment variables.

The upload stall threshold measures time since the last persisted upload
progress. If `MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_MAX_BYTES` is increased, reassess
`MULTIREMI_SESSION_ARCHIVE_UPLOAD_STALL_MS` against the maximum expected upload
duration and slowest supported connection.

## Backoff

The delay before another claim is `min(base * 2^(attempt - 1), max)`. A stable
jitter derived from the archive ID shifts each delay by up to 10 percent, while
the configured maximum remains a hard cap. With defaults, the nominal sequence
is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 minutes.

The next retry timestamp is written when an attempt is claimed. This protects
against failed uploads, stalled uploads, daemon crashes, and lost completion
requests. A stalled upload is recorded as failed before another claim is
considered.

## Exhaustion And Recovery

When the sixth automatic attempt fails or stalls, the archive remains visible as
failed with an exhausted retry state. Automatic claims stop until an administrator
uses the Retry action in the Issue's Provider Session Archives section or calls:

```text
POST /api/issues/:issueId/session-archives/:archiveId/retry
```

Manual retry records the current `attempt_count` as `retry_budget_base_attempt`
and clears the error, next retry timestamp, and exhaustion timestamp. The
attempt number never decreases; budget, backoff, and the displayed attempt count
use `attempt_count - retry_budget_base_attempt`. Existing rows start with base 0.
It does not bypass the normal upload integrity checks.

The final ZIP and `manifest.json` are shared paths. Only the current attempt
may rename or remove them, after checking ownership inside the archive row's
database lock. ZIP hashing, member validation, and manifest temp-file writing
stay outside that lock; the file mutations use synchronous operations inside it.

## v1 uploads during the upgrade window

New uploads must be the v2 ZIP container. The server identifies a v1 upload
from the request itself: an upgraded daemon names the v2 format in
`metadata.format`, and a request without that marker is the legacy container.
It answers `session_archive_format_unsupported` (409) before claiming an
attempt, so a daemon that has not upgraded yet cannot spend the retry budget on
a container this server no longer indexes. Because the refusal happens at `init`, the row
keeps its attempt count and the next claim after the daemon upgrade starts from
a clean budget.

Rows and files written by the v1 writer are never rewritten or deleted by this
rule: they keep their `ready` state because the hard-delete barrier binds the
cleaned workspace to one exact archive row.
