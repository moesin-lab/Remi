/**
 * The app-shell / page request gate (MUL-472 b, MUL-383 A5).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Every page used to pay for the shell's own requests (pins, invitations, the
 * CLI update hint, the sidebar badges, agent presence roll-ups) in its first
 * wave. A5 accepted moving them behind the route's first screen.
 *
 * ## When the gate opens (QA rework `cmt_r0euas6zfxff`)
 *
 * The first version opened the gate on the first idle slot after *its own*
 * mount. That is not the same thing as "the page has content": while the list
 * request is still in flight the browser is idle, so the gate opened before
 * the main content existed — measured 660 ms early for
 * `/api/agent-task-snapshot`, 102 ms for `/api/pins`.
 *
 * The gate now waits for two things, in order:
 *
 *  1. **this route's main content is ready** — published by the page itself
 *     through {@link useRouteContentReady}. The list pages publish the same
 *     condition that drives their `data-perf-scroll="list"` marker (query
 *     settled, not `keepPreviousData`); the issue detail publishes its own
 *     body readiness. Success, empty and failure all count: a failed list must
 *     not keep the deferred shell content away forever. Readiness is taken one
 *     animation frame later, so the rows have actually painted: a request that
 *     left in the same commit as the rows would still race the user's first
 *     look at them.
 *  2. **the first idle callback after that** (`requestIdleCallback` with a 1 s
 *     `timeout`, per A5).
 *
 * A route that never publishes readiness falls back to a
 * {@link AFTER_FIRST_SCREEN_CONTENT_FALLBACK_MS} timer measured from the moment
 * the route was first observed, and then takes the same idle step.
 *
 * ## Two classes of consumer
 *
 * The ruling splits the gated queries in two, because they behave differently
 * across a client-side navigation:
 *
 *  - **`scope: "page"`** — queries owned by a page that mounts and unmounts
 *    (`agent-task-snapshot`, `agents?include_archived`, `child-progress`,
 *    `squads`, …). They wait for the gate on *every* route change, and the new
 *    page's first render must already be `false`. That is why the state is kept
 *    as "which route key passed" rather than a single boolean: a stale `true`
 *    would leak into the new route's first render.
 *  - **`scope: "shell"`** — queries owned by a component that stays mounted
 *    across routes (the sidebar's pins, invitations, CLI hint and badges, the
 *    chat FAB). They wait only for the **first** page of the session; after
 *    that they never close again. Closing and reopening them on every
 *    navigation would re-issue expired requests and make hot navigation cost
 *    *more* than the pre-MUL-472 baseline.
 *
 * Both are safe against the other failure mode QA found: nothing here closes a
 * gate that a page's own content has already satisfied, and a page-level gate
 * is keyed by the route visit, so returning to an earlier path starts closed.
