# MUL-301: Chat / Issue ownership migration

Migration `20260916_chat_issue_decoupling` moves Issue ownership from
`multiremi_chat_sessions.issue_id` to
`multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings.issue_id`. Ordinary Chat create/update APIs no
longer accept Issue ownership. Existing Web/Feishu private conversations retain
their messages and working directories.

## Data transformation

- First consult synchronized Feishu messages for the same workspace and chat,
  with a source belonging to that workspace. Explicit `p2p` evidence prevents
  retaining an Issue association, even if other records claim `group`.
  Uncontradicted `group` evidence preserves the old association. No thread ID or
  `:thread:` key is a conversation-type signal.
- Without synchronized type evidence, preserve canonical
  `chat_issue_topic_<issueId>` bindings (including undelivered roots), or an
  automatic group Issue whose `feishu_bot_message` creation source matches the
  exact binding's destination and inbound delivery in the same workspace.
- Write every evaluated Feishu association, both preserved and discarded, to
  `multiremi_feishu_bot_issue_link_audit`. This permanent operator-only record
  contains the original Issue, complete identity/destination and subscription
  snapshots, disposition, independent canonical/marker/synchronized-type evidence
  flags, and the precedence-ordered decision reason. Evidence flags can overlap;
  `p2p_evidence` always overrides preservation. Other associations use reasons
  `canonical_topic`, `creation_provenance`, `synced_group` or `unproven_ownership`.
  Discarded associations have no active Issue binding. The audit table has **no runtime readers**: incoming messages never
  restore ownership, create summaries or replay old notifications from it.
  Private Web associations are discarded. No live Feishu lookup is required.
- A proactive destination is valid only when binding, push and task have the
  same non-null Issue and agree on workspace, Chat and Agent identity. Missing
  bindings and all mismatches fail closed. In the migration transaction, cancel
  invalid queued/dispatched wake tasks, revoke their task access tokens, delete
  unsent proactive work-round/human-request outbox entries, and remove unconsumed
  work-round system steering for those invalid destinations. This also settles
  Issue A's old notifications after the topic was rebound to Issue B; keeping B's
  valid binding does not authorize A's pending work. Valid tasks/queues survive.
- Keep ordinary user tasks, steering, replies and attachments. Clear surviving
  outbox dependencies on deleted notifications so ordinary attachments can
  proceed. Sent history remains unchanged. Runtime claim, payload and completion
  use the same destination consistency guard, and new notices cannot coalesce
  into an incompatible existing task.
- Cold-start ordinary Chat provider lineage once during migration, independently
  of old Issue fields or push records. This covers an explicitly unbound Chat
  that never produced a push. Clear provider/fingerprint/session pointers and
  clear runtime ownership when no working directory remains; retain `work_dir`
  with its origin runtime when one exists. Keep ordinary user/assistant history.
  Also clear provider pointers on retained topics carrying invalid historical
  work. Retained topics with consistent work keep their resumable provider.
- Clear inherited Issue/session pointers from other queued/dispatched ordinary
  Chat tasks. Running, awaiting-human and waiting-for-local-directory tasks keep
  an upgrade invalidation marker, so late completion or retries cannot promote
  their old provider lineage. The marker is task execution metadata; the audit
  table has no runtime readers. Payloads, CLI context, Issue creation and request
  provenance resolve effective Chat scope, preventing old private ownership
  from becoming new context.
- Remove non-topic notification channels and pending Issue update state, clear
  pending delivery flags, and remove only system messages starting with
  `Bound Issue update:` from non-topic Chats. Preserved topics retain their
  enabled/disabled subscription choices.
- Clear erroneous Issue Session pointers/generations from queued/dispatched Chat
  tasks, including topics. Startup backfills Issue Sessions only for non-Chat
  tasks. Drop `multiremi_chat_sessions.issue_id` and index binding ownership.
  No UI session management columns are removed.

### Binding decisions and Chat multiplicity

For each evaluated binding the precedence chain has exactly five reachable
reason/disposition pairs. Independent evidence flags may overlap:

| First matching evidence | Reason | Disposition | `binding_count=1` | `binding_count>=2` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any synchronized p2p | `p2p_evidence` | discarded | reachable | reachable |
| Canonical Chat ID, no p2p | `canonical_topic` | preserved | reachable | reachable |
| Exact creation delivery, neither above | `creation_provenance` | preserved | reachable | reachable |
| Synchronized group, none above | `synced_group` | preserved | reachable | reachable |
| No preservation evidence | `unproven_ownership` | discarded | reachable | reachable |

The opposite disposition for each reason is structurally impossible. This
exhausts single-binding decisions, not the shared Chat's aggregate outcome.
Classify each binding independently and review its Chat's entire binding set:

| Chat binding set | Ownership and provider outcome |
| --- | --- |
| No valid binding, including an ordinary Chat | Cold-start once. |
| One preserved binding | Retain its Issue; keep provider unless another invalid historical association/work item requires reset. |
| One discarded binding | Clear ownership and cold-start. |
| Multiple bindings, all preserved to the same Issue | Multiplicity alone does not force reset; inspect all destinations. |
| Multiple bindings, preserved + discarded | Cold-start the shared Chat. **Preserved bindings cannot cancel a discarded binding's reset.** |
| Multiple bindings, all discarded | Cold-start the shared Chat once. |
| Multiple live bindings retained to different Issues | **No cold-start fallback for the ambiguity itself.** If the old Chat/task Issue matches one valid binding and there is no invalid wake work, provider lineage survives. Resolve ownership separately before resuming traffic. |

Different-Issue retention is schema-reachable through prepopulated non-null
`binding.issue_id` values (manual repair/import/partial-draft data). This migration
only classifies NULL binding ownership, and copies the single `chat.issue_id` to
each newly preserved binding. Thus a clean migration cannot itself generate two
new preserved audit rows with different Issues on one Chat. Existing non-null
bindings bypass that classification and audit, but still participate in the
cold-start checks. Test this live-data case separately from synthetic audit-row
conflicts. No UNIQUE constraint or change to these migration semantics is made
by MUL-304.

## Historical group association exception

Starting with `421413f4` (2026-09-04 11:30, UTC+08:00), an Agent creating an Issue
inside Chat automatically linked that conversation. This included genuine
Feishu group topics; `747f2d1` tested reusing their original group topic. Those
records need not have a canonical ID or a `feishu_bot_message` source. The
separate group-only `autoCreateGroupIssue` path and its marker arrived together
in `bd9f8083` (2026-09-05 21:46, UTC+08:00), approximately 34 hours later.
**This is the origin window, not a safe date filter:** the generic path remained
possible afterward. Audit all old links, including more recent ones.

If a real group association has none of the three deterministic proofs above,
it is removed from active ownership. The group stops receiving Issue updates,
work-round reports and human-request notifications until an operator restores
that binding. Issue, Chat, ordinary message/task history, published results and
human requests remain; cancelled wake tasks and deleted notification deliveries
are not revived. There is no delayed recovery state or catch-up summary.

The affected production count is **not yet measured**. Unknown conversation type
must not be counted as a confirmed group, or inferred from a thread/key. Before
requesting deployment authorization, enumerate every dropped binding, confirm
unknown types through authoritative Feishu chat metadata, and report the actual
confirmed-group count, remaining unknown count, and recent activity. If there
are more than 10 affected group topics, an active topic in the past 7 days whose
interruption is unacceptable, or no deterministic coverage of active topics,
return those facts for a new decision before deployment.

## Audit before deployment authorization

1. Take and verify a consistent database backup. Restore it to an isolated copy
   with no daemon, bot credentials, traffic or outbound network delivery. Run the
   pre-migration multiplicity queries below before running the candidate migration
   there. This uses the actual migration's provenance checks
   rather than a second SQL implementation that could disagree with them.
2. On that migrated copy, run the queries below. Keep an export of audit records
   and type-verification evidence with the upgrade record. Inspect all dates.
   Do not print message bodies, task results or credentials in the report.
3. Record authoritative group/p2p decisions in the temporary review table. An
   unknown type remains unresolved until verified; SQL cannot infer it safely.
   Report counts to 贺华杰 before obtaining production deployment authorization.
4. After authorization, pause writes and inbound/daemon traffic, take the final
   backup, run the migration, and compare its audit set with the reviewed set.
   Investigate any new or changed row before resuming traffic.

These queries work on SQLite and PostgreSQL. Run the following two queries on
the isolated copy **before migration**; they need only the legacy binding table.
They group globally by Chat ID, including anomalous cross-workspace bindings.
The detail query returns every participating binding; `conflict_bindings` counts
all bindings in shared Chats, while `excess_bindings` counts only those beyond one
per Chat. An empty data set yields an empty detail list and zero summary counts.

```sql
-- mul301-audit-multiplicity-detail
WITH shared AS (
  SELECT chat_session_id, COUNT(*) AS binding_count
  FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings
  GROUP BY chat_session_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT b.chat_session_id, s.binding_count, b.id AS binding_id, b.workspace_id,
       b.app_id, b.agent_id, b.external_session_key
FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings b
JOIN shared s ON s.chat_session_id = b.chat_session_id
ORDER BY b.chat_session_id, b.workspace_id, b.id;
```

```sql
-- mul301-audit-multiplicity-summary
WITH shared AS (
  SELECT chat_session_id, COUNT(*) AS binding_count
  FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings
  GROUP BY chat_session_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS affected_chats,
       COALESCE(SUM(binding_count), 0) AS conflict_bindings,
       COALESCE(SUM(binding_count - 1), 0) AS excess_bindings
FROM shared;
```

Retain the conflict inventory for review. MUL-304 adds runtime guards to both
binding creation paths, but deliberately adds no UNIQUE constraint and does not
repair existing conflicts. Direct SQL/imports still require operator review.
The migration continues to cold-start a shared Chat if any binding is discarded.

Once `bindings.issue_id` exists, also run this live-ownership check, both before
migration on partial-draft/repaired schemas and after migration on every copy.
Do not run it on a legacy schema lacking that column: use the column-independent
inventory above first. Each returned row is one Chat requiring review; an empty
result means no multi-Issue conflict among currently valid live bindings. The
workspace/Agent/Issue joins match the migration's valid-binding definition.

```sql
-- mul301-audit-live-multi-issue
SELECT b.chat_session_id, COUNT(*) AS live_binding_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT b.issue_id) AS live_issue_count
FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings b
JOIN multiremi_chat_sessions c ON c.id = b.chat_session_id
  AND c.workspace_id = b.workspace_id AND c.agent_id = b.agent_id
JOIN multiremi_issues i ON i.id = b.issue_id AND i.workspace_id = b.workspace_id
GROUP BY b.chat_session_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT b.issue_id) > 1
ORDER BY b.chat_session_id;
```

Join these Chat IDs to the saved multiplicity inventory to review every binding
and destination. All-retained multi-Issue conflicts have **no automatic cold-start
fallback** when old Chat/task ownership matches a valid binding. They need a
separate operator ownership decision; a mixed disposition conflict is already
reset conservatively. Neither reset nor this report repairs shared ownership.

The remaining queries use the audit table, which exists only after migration;
before deployment, run them on the isolated migrated copy.

`last_inbound_at` and `active_last7d` are immutable observations as of each
row's `audited_at`. Activity uses the first receipt (`created_at`) of deliveries
for the exact workspace/binding, or the original creation time of synchronized
human messages for the same workspace, owned source, chat and exact thread/root.
Unknown senders, bots, another thread, metadata updates, retries, ingestion time,
and future/invalid timestamps cannot count as activity. An absent timestamp
means **no recorded inbound evidence**, not proof that the real group is inactive.
The seven-day window is inclusive, ending at `audited_at`; rerun the rehearsal on
a fresh backup if the report is stale. Do not use `chat_sessions.updated_at`.

```sql
-- mul301-audit-detail
SELECT workspace_id, binding_id, chat_session_id, issue_id, disposition, reason,
       classification_version, hit_canonical, hit_marker,
       hit_synced_group, hit_synced_p2p, audited_at,
       last_inbound_at, active_last7d, binding_snapshot
FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_issue_link_audit
ORDER BY workspace_id, binding_id;
```

Create this temporary review table and add verified decisions. Use the audited
workspace/binding, and retain the authority/source of the exact chat-type check.
Do not infer group type from thread/key, activity or dates. A blank table is
valid and leaves unproven links unresolved.

```sql
-- mul301-audit-review
CREATE TEMP TABLE mul301_type_review (
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  binding_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  confirmed_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (confirmed_type IN ('group', 'p2p')),
  evidence_ref TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (length(trim(evidence_ref)) > 0),
  PRIMARY KEY(workspace_id, binding_id)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO mul301_type_review VALUES
  ('<workspace-id>', '<verified-binding-id>', 'group', '<retained-evidence-reference>');
```

The following **single query** gives the decision inputs, including overlap-safe
coverage and authoritative recent activity. Run it after populating the review
rows (or with the empty review table to expose remaining unknowns).

```sql
-- mul301-audit-metrics
WITH classified AS (
  SELECT a.*,
    CASE WHEN a.hit_synced_p2p = 1 OR a.reason = 'p2p_evidence' OR r.confirmed_type = 'p2p' THEN 'p2p'

`evaluated_links` counts the migration's legacy Feishu Issue associations, not all
Chats. Per-rule raw hits include overlaps and p2p overrides; effective per-rule
coverage counts only preserved links. Their percentages must **not be added**.
Overall coverage counts each binding once. A zero denominator yields NULL, not
100% coverage. Review conflicts before relying on any type count. A claimed
`group` conflicting with `p2p_evidence` never authorizes restoration. Missing
activity must be checked externally where interruption could be unacceptable.
Record confirmed affected groups, unresolved links, active affected groups, and
both total/active preservation coverage with the deployment request.

`shared_chat_count` counts Chat IDs with multiple evaluated bindings, and
`shared_chat_binding_count` counts **all** evaluated bindings on those Chats.
`mixed_disposition_chat_count` and `mixed_disposition_binding_count` restrict
those counts to Chats containing both preserved and discarded decisions.
`preserved_group_discarded_p2p_chat_count` identifies the specific preserved-group
plus confirmed-discarded-p2p shape; review evidence conflicts before interpreting
the group label. `preserved_multi_issue_chat_count` counts Chats with at least two
distinct Issues among preserved audit rows, including sets that also contain
discarded rows. These are overlapping counts, not additive categories.
They use the immutable `chat_session_id` audit column, independent of live
bindings or JSON functions. They cover evaluated legacy Issue links only;
the pre-migration inventory also catches bindings without a legacy Issue.
Older audit rows lack Chat identity: `missing_chat_identity_rows` exposes them
and makes all six shared-Chat metrics NULL, rather than claiming zero conflicts.
Rehearse from the pre-decoupling backup to fill that gap; do not backfill from
mutable live bindings. An empty audit gives zero conflict counts and NULL coverage.

The multi-Issue audit metric detects anomalous historical/imported audit sets;
it cannot cover non-null live bindings skipped by this migration. A zero value
does **not** establish unambiguous live ownership. Always pair it with
`mul301-audit-live-multi-issue` and the pre-migration inventory. Retained A/B
bindings have no ambiguity-triggered cold-start fallback; report them separately
from mixed disposition counts and keep traffic paused for an ownership decision.

Fresh migration records have `classification_version = 2`. Earlier unpublished
drafts lack retained decisions and authoritative activity; rows from them remain
version 1, and coverage is NULL whenever any is present. Rehearse from a verified
pre-decoupling backup to obtain a complete denominator; restarting a migrated
draft cannot reconstruct absent rows. Save review evidence outside the temporary
table; it is not application state. These metrics have no date filter.

## Restore a confirmed group before resuming traffic

Restore each reviewed binding individually, in a transaction, **before the daemon
accepts messages again**. Otherwise a new group message can trigger automatic
creation of a replacement Issue; investigate and reconcile that duplicate before
restoring. Never restore a private or unverified conversation. A link can be
restored from its audit snapshots without restoring the full database, but keep
the verified pre-upgrade backup until the rollback decision is closed. Keep the
audit row after restoration as an immutable record.

Read `binding_snapshot` and `channel_snapshot` for the one audited row. Verify
its Issue and Chat still exist in the same workspace, the bot/app/Agent/session
and every destination field are unchanged, and authoritative group evidence is
current. Do not recreate a missing/deleted Chat or transplant the link to another
thread. Review the complete binding set for that Chat, including bindings in
other workspaces. The SQL below refuses shared Chats: reconcile any conflict
through a separately reviewed repair plan first, and rerun the inventory; do not
delete a binding or choose an Issue merely to make this UPDATE succeed.
Substitute the exact snapshot values below, SQL-escaping strings; use SQL
`NULL` for null thread/reply values. Run one binding at a time. This is an offline
maintenance procedure, not a new public bind API.

```sql
-- mul301-audit-restore
BEGIN;
UPDATE multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings
SET issue_id = (
  SELECT issue_id FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_issue_link_audit
  WHERE binding_id = '<binding-id>' AND workspace_id = '<workspace-id>'
    AND disposition = 'discarded' AND reason = 'unproven_ownership'
    AND classification_version = 2 AND hit_synced_p2p = 0
)
WHERE id = '<binding-id>' AND workspace_id = '<workspace-id>'
  AND issue_id IS NULL
  AND app_id = '<audited-app-id>' AND agent_id = '<audited-agent-id>'
  AND external_session_key = '<audited-external-session-key>'
  AND chat_session_id = '<audited-chat-session-id>'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_chat_bindings other
    WHERE other.chat_session_id = '<audited-chat-session-id>' AND other.id <> '<binding-id>'
  )
  AND chat_id = '<authoritatively-verified-group-chat-id>'
  AND thread_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM '<audited-thread-id-or-SQL-NULL>'
  AND reply_to_message_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM '<audited-reply-id-or-SQL-NULL>'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM multiremi_chat_sessions c
    WHERE c.id = '<audited-chat-session-id>' AND c.workspace_id = '<workspace-id>'
  )
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM multiremi_feishu_bot_issue_link_audit a
    JOIN multiremi_issues i ON i.id = a.issue_id AND i.workspace_id = a.workspace_id
    WHERE a.binding_id = '<binding-id>' AND a.workspace_id = '<workspace-id>'
      AND a.disposition = 'discarded' AND a.reason = 'unproven_ownership'
      AND a.classification_version = 2 AND a.hit_synced_p2p = 0
  )
RETURNING id, issue_id;
-- Require exactly one returned row; otherwise ROLLBACK and investigate.
```

If `channel_snapshot` is non-null, restore that exact row in the same transaction,
including `enabled`, `event_types`, `min_severity`, owner and target. Verify its
kind is `agent_chat`, its workspace matches, and `target.chatId` is the audited
Chat. Do not replace an existing channel or silently enable a disabled one. The
following parameters are copied from that snapshot, not new defaults:

```sql
-- mul301-audit-restore-channel
INSERT INTO multiremi_notification_channels
  (id, workspace_id, member_id, kind, name, enabled, target, event_types,
   min_severity, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES
  ('<channel-id>', '<workspace-id>', '<member-id-or-SQL-NULL>', 'agent_chat',
   '<name>', <enabled-0-or-1>, '<target-json>', '<event-types-json>',
   '<min-severity>', '<creator-or-SQL-NULL>', '<created-at>', '<updated-at>')
RETURNING id, enabled, event_types;
-- A conflicting ID is an error: ROLLBACK and inspect, never overwrite it.
COMMIT;
```

When the snapshot is null, skip the INSERT and commit the verified binding
update without inventing a subscription. Null placeholders mean unquoted SQL
`NULL`, not the string `'NULL'`. For a repeat attempt where the binding already
has the audited Issue, verify all identity and channel fields before treating it
as already restored; never overwrite a different live Issue.

Before COMMIT, require exactly one returned binding and, when applicable, one
channel; any error, identity mismatch, or zero-row result means ROLLBACK of the
entire repair. After COMMIT, read back binding and subscription fields, rerun
both live conflict queries, and retain the repair record with operator, time,
binding/Issue IDs and evidence references. Resume traffic only after all changed
or unresolved destinations have been reviewed. Do not restore
old provider/session pointers, pending updates, cancelled wake tasks or deleted
outbox rows. Future events use the normal topic path; missed notifications are
not replayed. The retained Issue/task/human-request records remain queryable.
A claim-time binding check is an additional invariant, not a paused queue.
Messages already claimed by a daemon, currently sending or sent before upgrade
cannot be withdrawn by this migration.

Earlier PR #192 drafts that already discarded ambiguous links cannot reconstruct
them by restarting this revision. Rehearse from a verified pre-decoupling backup;
do not use a previously migrated draft database as evidence of this migration.

PostgreSQL and legacy SQLite schemas with an inline Issue foreign key use native
`ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`. A shipped SQLite schema instead has a table-level
Issue foreign key, which SQLite cannot remove by dropping its referenced
column. That schema is rebuilt inside the migration transaction:

1. Create a replacement from the original table definition, removing only the
   Issue column and its table-level foreign key.
2. Copy every remaining column using an explicit column list.
3. Drop the old table, rename the replacement, and recreate captured indexes and
   triggers. Keeping the original name until the old table is dropped avoids
   rewriting dependent foreign keys toward a temporary name.
4. Compare Chat, Chat message, and Feishu binding row counts before and after
   the rebuild. Any mismatch throws and rolls back the migration.

The SQLite foreign-key enforcement setting is saved and temporarily disabled
before this transaction only when a rebuild needs it, then restored in a
`finally` block. An initially disabled setting stays disabled. Deliberate
removal of private system update messages happens **after** the rebuild/count
check, independently from user/assistant history preservation.

The migration ledger entry and ownership transformation share one transaction.
Repeated startup does not repeat the migration or recreate Chat ownership.
Regression tests cover both SQLite schema shapes with enforcement on/off,
unknown extra columns/indexes/triggers, provider resume reset, queued/dispatched task
cleanup, rollback after injected dependent-row loss, and restoration of a
verified pre-upgrade SQLite backup. Both SQLite schema shapes and the real
PostgreSQL backend cover p2p conversations with thread/key combinations,
automatic group creation without thread markers, and missing, malformed or
mismatched creation provenance. These cases verify provider reset, pending task
isolation, message preservation, and update channel/state cleanup as well as
ownership and repeated startup.

## Reproducible cold-start benchmark (MUL-304)

Use Bun 1.3.14 from the repository root:

```bash
bun scripts/bench-chat-issue-migration.ts
bun scripts/bench-chat-issue-migration.ts --backend sqlite --sizes 5000,20000,50000 --repeats 1
# Configure MUL304_BENCH_POSTGRES_URL privately for a disposable local PG server.
bun scripts/bench-chat-issue-migration.ts --backend postgres --sizes 5000,20000,50000 --repeats 1
```

The default runs both backends at all three sizes. The PG URL must use a loopback
host with no URL query parameters, and its role needs CREATE DATABASE permission.
The script never uses `MULTIREMI_DATABASE_URL`, accepts no existing SQLite file,
and creates a new randomly named `mul304_bench_*` PG database for every sample.
It drops only the database it just created, and removes its own temporary SQLite
directory. No production server, 209, bot or daemon is contacted. A missing local
PG server emits `status: unavailable` for each requested size and exit code 2;
it must not be reported as a successful PG measurement.

Each sample has N ordinary Chats, N active tasks (equally split across queued,
dispatched, running, awaiting-human and waiting-local-directory states), and 2N
retained user/assistant messages. All Chats start with legacy Issue/provider
pointers; half have a work directory and machine affinity. There are no Feishu
bindings, subscriptions, pushes, attachments or long histories in this fixture.
This isolates the full ordinary-Chat cold-start cost; it does **not** estimate
binding-audit or outbound-queue cost, provider response time, or total production
upgrade duration. Use the isolated real-data rehearsal to include those costs.

SQLite uses a temporary disk database, WAL, synchronous FULL and the shipped
table-level Issue foreign key, exercising the rebuild path. PG uses the actual
synchronous store adapter and native DROP COLUMN. NDJSON output records machine
metadata and `setupMs`, `migrationMs`, `restartMs` separately. `migrationMs` times
the complete `runMigrations` call, including commit and other idempotent startup
work; fixture generation and verification are excluded. Successful samples
verify row counts, provider invalidation, preserved messages/work directories,
task states, the migration ledger and that restarting does not cold-start again.

MUL-304 creates `idx_multiremi_tasks_chat_session` immediately after adding the
task Chat column, before the ownership migration transaction and its per-Chat
updates. The index is also installed on stores whose decoupling ledger already
exists; it does not rerun cold-start. The benchmark removes the bootstrap-created
index after seeding, so measured migration time includes building it on all N
tasks. The migration algorithm and classification/reset semantics are unchanged.

SQLite measurements on 2026-09-16, Bun 1.3.14, Linux x64, Intel Xeon Platinum
8457C, 32 exposed CPUs / 62.64 GiB RAM, temporary disk WAL/FULL:

| Chats / active tasks | Before index, seconds | With index, seconds (3 runs) | New median | Migration-only planning allowance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5k / 5k | 8.308 / 8.556 / 8.457 | 0.26248 / 0.26252 / 0.27460 | 0.26252 s | >=1 s |
| 20k / 20k | 226.043 (1 run) | 1.12394 / 1.02512 / 0.95720 | 1.02512 s | >=3 s |
| 50k / 50k | 1,827.137 (1 run) | 2.88817 / 3.15248 / 3.42588 | 3.15248 s | >=7 s |

All nine indexed samples passed data and idempotency checks; restart took
9.95–38.37 ms. The allowances round twice the slowest indexed sample up to whole
seconds. They replace the pre-index migration allowances in the first benchmark
report. They are **not complete production pause windows**. PostgreSQL at all
three sizes remained unavailable locally (exit 2); no PG timings were obtained.

For a paused-write window, measure the final isolated rehearsal on comparable
hardware and data. Budget traffic drain + backup + at least twice the slowest
measured migration + startup/readback time, plus the separately measured restore
time when planning the rollback cutoff. The factor of two is planning headroom,
not a performance guarantee. Do not extrapolate linearly from the 5k sample or
reuse a SQLite result as a PG estimate. This benchmark does not measure provider
state that never reached storage or the user impact of history-budget truncation.
Provider-internal unsaved context cannot be recovered by preserving UI messages;
history-budget limits may omit early events on the next turn. Review critical
long-running conversations during the isolated rehearsal and communicate the
one-time fresh provider session. This benchmark supplies no quantitative user
impact estimate for those cases.

Before starting the window, record drain, verified-backup, measured-migration,
startup/readback and tested-restore budgets separately. Stop new inbound work and
task dispatch, settle or fence already claimed/in-flight work, and verify no
writers remain before the final backup. Set the rollback decision deadline to
the end of the approved pause window minus tested restore time and old-version
startup/readback time. If migration or review cannot finish by that deadline,
keep traffic paused and take the agreed rollback path; do not extend the window
using the synthetic numbers as a promise. Restoring after traffic resumes can
lose new writes and needs a new reconciliation/data-loss decision.

## Rollback procedure

Take and verify a full database backup before upgrading, and pause writes for
the upgrade window. Use a consistent SQLite backup (including committed WAL
state) or a PostgreSQL database backup, not a copy of a live SQLite main file.

- **Migration failure:** its transaction rolls back the binding ownership copy,
  table rebuild/drop, cleanup, and migration ledger entry. Fix the cause and
  retry startup; tests exercise this path. Other earlier startup migrations may
  already have committed independently, including this task index. Its presence
  after a failed decoupling transaction does not imply ownership was migrated;
  inspect the ledger and schema. Do not remove the index just to retry.
- **Rollback after successful migration:** stop the upgraded service, restore the
  verified pre-upgrade database backup, and run the prior application version.
  Do not merely start old code against the new schema. The intentionally
  discarded private associations/system broadcasts and provider resume pointers
  cannot be reconstructed from the new binding table. Restoring the backup also
  discards writes made since the backup, which is why the paused-write upgrade
  window matters.

Single-binding restoration above is a forward repair, not rollback: it does not
undo schema changes, revive provider state or replay missed notifications. Keep
audit exports and operator decisions outside the database backup being restored.
Before restarting the prior version, verify backup integrity, expected schema
and application version; read back data and health with writers still paused.
Never combine an old application with a successfully decoupled database or
attempt to synthesize the dropped Chat Issue column from ambiguous bindings.

This change supplies migration code and local verification only; it does not run
an upgrade or alter a production database.
