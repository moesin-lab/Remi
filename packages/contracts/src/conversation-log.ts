 * log that replaces `multiremi_session_events`, `multiremi_issue_comments` and
 * `multiremi_chat_messages` (MUL-402, message architecture v2-B; ADR 0006).
 *
 * One row is one display unit: `head` at seq 0, `message`, `system`, `turn` and
 * `result_published` and `follow_frozen`. Every other lifecycle fact the agent projections and the
 * wake-up rules depend on stays on the same seq axis as a `visibility = "hidden"`
 * marker, so lane cursors, projection windows and the browser replica keep
 * reading one ordering. The kind names are the production values; `task_assigned`
 * is renamed to `turn`, which keeps the backfill a 1:1 copy instead of a lossy
 * mapping.
 *
 * Type-only module plus the kind constants. The writer and the read routes land
 * in MUL-426 (B1).
