 * hand-edited counter, so a change that alters output cannot ship without
 * changing the value.

 * Bump `RENDER_PIPELINE_REVISION` for changes that are not visible in the

 * pair, the 64 KiB downgrade threshold, the prepasses this renderer ports.

 * whatever is installed, so an upgrade that is not reflected here would leave
 * stale `body_html` behind.
 *
 * Every entry is checked against the installed manifest by
