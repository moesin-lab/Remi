/**
 * Realtime fanout (MUL-462, MUL-455 §1.4).
 *
 * The store raises four in-process events (`onTaskEnqueued`, `onTaskEvent`,
 * `onTaskMessages`, `onWorkspaceEvent`). Before the API could be split into a
 * browser-facing and a daemon-facing process, `server.ts` subscribed to all four
 * inline and delivered straight to the two WebSocket registries it owned.
 *
 * Once there are two processes that stops working: the process that writes an
 * event is not necessarily the one holding the WebSocket. This module is that
 * wiring, named and testable. It subscribes to the store once and does two
 * things per event:
 *
 *   - deliver locally, by role — `ui`/`all` to the browser registries;
 *   - hand the raw event to the peer channel, which forwards it to the other
 *     process (see `peer/peer-channel.ts`).
 *
 * Events that arrive *from* the peer take the local-delivery path only and are
 * never forwarded again — that is what stops two processes echoing one event.
 * Daemon v2 owns its socket separately; A-2 removed the v1 wake-up registry.
 * Peer-delivered task and workspace events call the same daemon hooks as local
 * events, so the runtime process can wake offers and DB-derived downlinks.
 *
 * `MULTIREMI_PEER_URL` unset means `peer` is null: local delivery only, and no
 * envelope is even built — exactly the pre-split behaviour.
 *
 * A peer event may arrive degraded (the sender dropped the task body because it
 * did not fit one POST). Those carry a task id instead, and this process shares
 * the sender's database, so it re-reads the row and builds the same frame. A
 * Header-degraded `task_messages` keeps its message; persisted seq references
 * instead page through current committed rows. Only browser frames consume the
 * messages, and references need not preserve overwritten intermediate versions.
